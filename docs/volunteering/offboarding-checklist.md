# Offboarding Checklist

From time to time volunteers may decide that they would like to leave the
organisation to focus on other things. When this happens we should try to ensure
that anything they're responsible for is handed over to another volunteer.

This checklist aims to provide prompts for things which might need to be handed
over.

## Third Party Services

- Check [the list][list-third-party-services] of who is configured as the
  "owner" of each third party service that we use and transfer as needed.

- Check whether there are any other services which the volunteer manages
  directly (e.g: packages on PyPI, projects in ReadTheDocs) and either confirm
  that they're happy to continue maintaining those or transfer as needed.
