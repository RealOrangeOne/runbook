# Calendars

We use a few calendars to organise events, both public and private.

## Volunteer Calendar

We use [a Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) to track events relevant to volunteers.

## Website

Our [website](https://studentrobotics.org) emits a calendar feed, which can be used to keep track of [public events](https://studentrobotics.org/events/) in the [competition programme](../competition/README.md).

To add this feed to your calendar, subscribe to the following URL: https://studentrobotics.org/events.ics.
