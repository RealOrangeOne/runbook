# Calendars

We use a few calendars to organise events, both public and private.

## Volunteer Calendar

We use [a Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=studentrobotics.org_oqdjasvpps8smo0d5nte417rak%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) to track events relevant to volunteers.

### Creating events

To create events in the calendar, ensure you have the correct permissions (all committee members should have this).

Creating and customizing the event should be the same as any other Google Calendar, just make sure to add the event to the right calendar.

If the event is intended to have people attend (most probably are), be sure to invite the correct people / group. Committees and teams have their own email aliases, along with the one for all volunteers. This allows individuals to RSVP to the events they intend to attend, as well as notifying them about the event itself.

## Website

Our [website](https://studentrobotics.org) emits a calendar feed, which can be used to keep track of [public events](https://studentrobotics.org/events/) in the [competition programme](../competition/README.md).

To add this feed to your calendar, subscribe to the following URL: https://studentrobotics.org/events.ics.
