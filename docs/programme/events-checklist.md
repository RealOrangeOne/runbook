# Event organisation

This checklist enumerates the tasks that need to be completed to run a generic event.

## Timings

In general we should prefer to share as much (confirmed) information with
attendees as early as possible. For example: announcing a firm date early and
then confirming a venue later is preferable to holding back date information.

Schools typically need at least a month (often more) in order to book events
outside the timetable and especially excursion away from school. This should be
considered when planning events.

## Planning

- Identify and book a venue
    - consider travel & parking
    - consider power & internet access
    - consider accommodation (if major event)
- Finalise the date
- Prepare a risk assessment (add to https://studentrobotics.org/risk-assessments/)

## Announcement

- Event page on the website
    - directions to the venue and/or map
    - parking at the venue (maybe show on map)
    - map of the venue itself (if major event)
    - event schedule
    - where to get food

- Blog post on the website (if major event)
- Email to attendees
- Post in Slack (if volunteers)
- Post in Discord (if teams)
- Post on social media
