# Competition Programme

Student Robotics primary activity is the running of the annual Competition
Programme which culminates in the [Competition Event][competition-event].

This section outlines the running that programme, though note that some aspects
(notably the competition event and [competitor teams][teams]) are large enough
to have their own sections.

## Timeline

* Kickstart, usually around October/November
* Tech Days, to help teams throughout the year
* [Competition][competition-event], usually a weekend in April
