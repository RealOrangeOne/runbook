# Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to get help if they’re struggling with a technical issue, and a controlled environment for students to make more progress on their robots. They’re also an opportunity to see how well they’re doing in comparison to other teams.

When mentoring teams, it's advised to read our [mentor guidance](../volunteering/mentor-guidance.md).

## Lightning talks

At tech days, we often run "Lightning talks", a way for competitors to show off their robot, talk about how they're getting on, and potentially give a demo. These lightning talks should only be 2 minutes maximum, and whilst they should be encouraged, are not required.

Historically, lightning talks have been done immediately after lunch, allowing teams to plan what they're going to say over lunch.

## Feedback

At the end of a tech day, it's useful to ask the teams how they got on, and how we could run a better tech day.

This doesn't need to take the form of a questionnaire, just a quick discussion.

Some example questions:

1. What were your objectives for the Tech Day?
2. Do you feel that these objectives were successfully met?
3. What problems did you encounter in achieving these objectives?
4. Did you solve those problems, and if so, how?
5. What changes would you put in place in future to avoid those problems?
6. Did you find that the information you needed to fulfil your objectives was readily available to you? If not, please go into specifics.
7. Were there any new initiatives that you tried that you felt were particularly successful?
8. Are there any changes you would make to the way that future Tech Days are organised, other than those you've already described above.
