Work needs to be done to produce guidance for LTCs about how to organise a Tech Day.

Feedback questions for Tech Days:

  1. What were your objectives for the Tech Day?
  2. Do you feel that these objectives were successfully met?
  3. What problems did you encounter in achieving these objectives?
  4. Did you solve those problems, and if so, how?
  5. What changes would you put in place in future to avoid those problems?
  6. Did you find that the information you needed to fulfil your objectives was
      readily available to you? If not, please go into specifics.
  7. Were there any new initiatives that you tried that you felt were
     particularly successful?
  8. Are there any changes you would make to the way that future Tech Days
      are organised, other than those you've already described above.
