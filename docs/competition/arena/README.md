# Arena

This is information about constructing and de-constructing the arenas area at
the competition. This includes:

* Arena carpet
* Arena walls
* All props in the arena, including:
    * Markers
    * Any fixed or mobile installations in the arena (tokens, pedestals, etc.)
* Displays around the arena
* Staging area (for robots on their way in & out of the arenas)
* Audience barriers

## Tasks

The following tasks are generally applicable from one year to the next. As the responsibilities of the role change these tasks should be updated to suit.

Pre-competition (in no particular order):

* Specify the following and communicate requirements to the Production Manager, who will handle hire:
    * Network equipment (switches, cables, etc). Work with Competition Software Coordinator to spec.
    * Power equipment.
    * Screens and screen mounts. Work with Competition Software Coordinator to spec.
    * Desks and chairs for the staging and match coordination areas.
    * Crowd barriers for use around the arenas and the staging area.
* Specify and order tape. A non-exhaustive list:
    * Coloured gaffer for corner related things (e.g. game props, corner markings, robot badges).
    * Double-sided for carpet laying.
    * Double-sided tape for marker application (arena and tokens).
    * Black gaffer tape for carpet edge and other misc uses.
    * White gaffer tape for game props (if required) and other misc uses.
* Specify and order carpet.
* Specify and order libkoki markers (game dependent) and arena labels. (Check arena labels from the previous year to assess suitability.)
* Specify and order materials for game props (e.g. cardboard boxes).
* Work with Competition Software Coordinator to arrange for display computers to be available during set up.
* Specify and source/order arena walls (we already own some, so only required if they change).
* Work with the [Head Shepherd](../matches/shepherding.md#head-shepherd) to define the layout of the match staging area. (In the past it has been helpful to build a mockup using tables & chairs and real measurements and use that to practise each stage of the match cycle)

Setup (roughly in time order):

* Install carpet.
* Install arena walls.
* Install markings on arena floor in accordance with the game rules, to denote the starting positions of props and to provide human readable markings (corner numbers).
* Install crowd barriers around arenas and staging area.
* Install labels on the outside of each arena to identify the arena (e.g. 'A' and 'B').
* Install fire extinguishers (1 per arena).
* Install network for corner screens and match coordination area.
* Install power for corner screens and match coordination area.
* Install the corner screens.
* Install the display hardware onto the back of the screens.
* Install staging area desks and one-way system (tape on the floor + signs).
* Install staging area management bay, for the storage of competition USB keys and robot badges.
