# Network

At the competition we generally have two networks of interest:

* A "competition" network, which connects together our competition operational
  systems (score entry, arena displays, general information displays, etc.)
* A more general network which provides internet access to guests (competitors
  and volunteers)

## Preparation

A survey of the venue before the event is strongly encouraged to ensure that the
planned layout will match what's physically in the venue. This is based on
feedback from SR2019.
