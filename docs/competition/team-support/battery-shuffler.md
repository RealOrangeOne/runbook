# Battery Shuffler

A battery shuffler is a volunteer that moves batteries, battery chargers, battery charger PSUs and battery charging bags from the arrival desk to the battery charging station on Saturday morning and between the battery charging station and the kit return desk on Sunday afternoon.

**In SR2019, the arrival desk is the same desk as reception.**

## Saturday Morning Shuffling

Teams arrive on Saturday morning between 9:00 and 9:30. When they arrive we take the following items off of them at the arrival desk:

* 2x batteries
* 1x battery charger
* 1x battery charger power supply
* 1x battery charging bag

All of these parts need to be carried from the arrival desk to the battery charging station where they will be used by us to manage the charging of batteries.

The arrival desk will be taking batteries/chargers/bags from teams as they arrive, as we do not allow teams to charge their own batteries. The Battery Shuffler needs to continually carry these items to the battery charging station. They must repeat this until most teams have arrived.

## Sunday Afternoon Shuffling

Some teams have a loan extension approved prior to the competition. These teams will need to be given all of the parts taken off of them before they leave the venue on Sunday to be able to make use of their kit. At 15:00 the Battery Shuffler needs to gather sufficient parts (batteries, chargers, charger PSUs and battery bags) to give to the teams with loan extensions, place them into a box labelled 'Batteries/Chargers for loan extensions', then take it down to the kit return desk and hand it to the Competition Team Coordinator.
