# Door Guard Volunteer

At the end of the competition, teams tend to evaporate without warning. We wish
to ensure that they return the loaned SR kit, unless they've arranged otherwise.
To this end, door guards are people who guard the exit doors at the venue:
near the reception end of the building there are exits to the car park.

Door guards shouldn't constrict access to the exits, but instead challenge
people exiting:

* Has your team been signed out at reception?
* (If carrying kit **without** a kit authorisation sticker on it) Send them to the kit return desk before allowing them to leave. If they think they should be able to retain their kit (pre-agreed with SR before the competition), make sure they have visited the kit return desk prior to leaving to obtain the relevant authorisation sticker.
* (If carrying kit **with** a kit authorisation sticker) Allow them to leave.

Guard duty starts from the moment the kickoffs begin (many teams don't wait
for awards or to see matches they aren't participating in before leaving).
