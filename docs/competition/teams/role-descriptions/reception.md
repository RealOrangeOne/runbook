# Reception Volunteer

Reception staff control entry to the building and validate people's Media Consent Forms (MCFs) and/or wristbands. Each reception staffer has their own desk and chair.

**Everyone** must complete a MCF, Under 16's must have this form completed by a parent or guardian. If someone denies Media Consent, write down which team they are in, and hand them a red lanyard. If someone is under-16 and has no pre-signed form, speak to the Volunteer in charge.

When someone enters the building, you should follow the procedure below.

![Reception Desk Flow](../diagrams/reception-desk-flow.svg)

At the start of the competition day, there will be four reception staffers
covering the entrance. Once the initial influx of people is complete, this
will reduce. Additionally, after the initial influx, receptionists
should allow people wearing SR wristbands to enter the building at will (they
should check that people walking in have one, or follow the procedure above).

Throughout the competition, reception staffers will encounter a variety of
members of the public enquiring what the event is, or otherwise receiving
questions. Please answer as fully as possible, but refer any technical or kit questions
to the helpdesk. Any member of the public should be allowed into the building if they sign a media consent
form.

# Handling Team Arrivals
When a team first arrives or leaves, your role as reception is to log this and confiscate items on entry, see below:

* Team entry/exit recording
 	* Arrival desk staff will have sign-in / sign-out sheet for team supervisors to
record that their teams have arrived and when they leave. Reception will direct
team supervisors and robot kit to the desk; you should get the team supervisor to sign the sheet.
* Removing batteries, chargers, and bags:
 	* When on-site, we handle battery charging and robot safety, this means we should take all of the following items from each team:
 		* 2 x Battery
 		* 1 x Battery chargers
		* 1 x Battery charging bags
		* 1 x Battery charging power supply unit (PSU)


The following flow is an outline of the processes described above:
