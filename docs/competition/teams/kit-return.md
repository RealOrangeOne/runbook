# Kit Return

After the competition, teams need to return their kits to us, so they can be cleaned, validated and reused for the next competition.

At the end of a competition, kits should be collected at reception. Teams must return their kit unless they have already had a kit loan extension agreed.

The [role description](https://studentrobotics.org/kitbook/competition/teams/role-descriptions/kit-return/#teams-keeping-kit) has more information about this process.

## Kit loan extension

Sometimes, teams wish to keep their kit for a few weeks after the competition has ended. Historically, we've allowed extensions for up to 3 weeks after the competition date, so long as they let us know prior to 2 weeks before the competition.
