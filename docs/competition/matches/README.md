# Matches

At the competition we run a large number of matches, during which the robots
compete in an Arena. This section provides information about the running of
those matches.

## Robot safety inspections

Before any robot may compete in a match, it must be inspected to ensure that it
is safe and complies with the game rules. This is typically organised by the
volunteer in charge of Health & Safety.

A checklist for such inspections (from SR2016) exists at
