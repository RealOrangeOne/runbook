# Livestream

Some events, such as the [competition](../README.md) online-only events are livestreamed.

## Platforms

Events are streamed to the Student Robotics [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/studentrobotics) account.

## Software

We use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) as the livestreaming software used to transmit the video feeds to YouTube. OBS deals with mixing, scene transmission and screen capture.

OBS configuration is split into 2 fundamental objects: Scenes and Sources. A scene is the thing shown on screen, which is made up of multiple sources.

## Hardware

The hardware requirements for hosting a livestream are not large, however a stable internet connection is a must. A dedicated GPU is useful to ensure the system isn't taxed too heavily.

## Music

As background music during livesteams, we'll often play quiet music.

For finals events, more dramatic music is played vs other sessions, to emphasize the importance. For finals events, we have heavily used [Monstercat](https://www.monstercat.com/) in the past, and for other events [incompetech](https://incompetech.com/), as these sources can be used without purchasing a licence, provided the required attribution is given.

There is no simple playlist used for each event. The playlists for each event are built off the previous, with any new finds added and disliked tracks removed.

During live events, the music played throughout the venue needs to be stripped out, usually through a separate audio feed.

Audio can either be played directly through OBS using the VLC source, or through a desktop audio player, so long as any other system sound effects are muted.
