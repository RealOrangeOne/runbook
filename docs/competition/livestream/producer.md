# Producer

The producer is responsible for managing what content is being shown on the screen at a given time. This is the person who will be running OBS and switching scenes as needed.

!!! note

    It's highly recommend that the producer not have another role, to ensure any issues can be resolved as quickly as possible

Before an event, it's important to test the technologies and processes which will be used, especially if it involves remote sources.

It's important to be monitoring both the YouTube chat and internal discussions (e.g. on Slack) in case of issues.
Whilst the producer doesn't need to appear at all on the livestream, it can be useful to have a mic to communicate quickly and easily with the other hosts.
