# Kit Hardware

This section contains information about the hardware used for the Kit.

The current iteration of the kit is generally known as the "v4" kit, which was incrementally introduced during SR2014 and SR2015. For SR2023, a new Raspberry Pi 4 based Brain Board was introduced.

A list of parts contained within a kit can be found on the [Student facing docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/).
