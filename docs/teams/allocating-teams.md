# Allocating Teams

### Required information

When collecting information from teams, the following information must be collected:

  * Team Leader Name
  * Team Leader Email address
  * Team Leader Phone number
  * Organisation
  * Organisation address
  * Organisation postcode
  * Desired kickstart location
  * Whether the organisation would benefit from a second kit / team

Once teams have been registered, allocate them a TLA. This TLA must be unique for all teams this competition year, be based roughly on their organisation name, and not be construed for rude language. If a team has competed before, re-use their previously allocated TLA. If a TLA was previously given to a different organisation, calculate a new one.

If this is the first year a given institution is competing, they are considered a rookie. This should also be noted with the rest of their team information.

## Confirming places

Once signup has closed, teams need to be informed they have a place in the year's competition.

If possible, confirm places in batches before the deadline, rather than all at once after the deadline. This provides an insentive for signing up sooner, as it confirms places quicker, enabling team leaders to organise kickstart trips with more notice.

### Example emails
