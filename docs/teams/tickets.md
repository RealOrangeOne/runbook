# Tickets & media consent

!!! note
    This process is currently being [reviewed](https://github.com/srobo/tasks/issues/286).

At competitions, lots of photos are taken. To ensure we have the right to use and distribute them, we use media consent forms.

The media consent form lives in the [`media-consent`](https://github.com/srobo/media-consent) repository.

If a competitor is under the age of 16, they will need to get a parent or guardian to sign on their behalf. Because of this, if a competitor under 16 attends the competition without a signed media consent form, they will be unable to enter.

## Tickets

Once a form has been completed and returned, it is validated and processed. Once the competitor has been marked as having given consent, they are sent an email with their ticket. This ticket must be brought with them to the competition to gain entry.

These tickets are collected at [reception](../competition/teams/role-descriptions/reception.md), and exchanged for wristbands, which double as proof of consent.
