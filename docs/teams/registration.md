# Team Registration

Before a competition, institutions need to register their interest for entering team(s).

## Sign up form

To collect details for a team, a signup form needs to be created to capture:

- School / institution name
- School / institution address
- Team leader first name
- Team leader last name
- Team leader email address
- Whether they've competed in Student Robotics before
- How many teams they would like to enter (usually 1)
- Which (if any) kickstart they wish to attend (if there are multiple)

!!!warning
    Signing up does not guarantee a team's place in Student Robotics.

    Having a preference of kickstart does not guarantee their place there.

The created form should then be embedded in the [website](https://studentrobotics.org/compete/) ([example PR](https://github.com/srobo/website/pull/230)).

### Outside sign up period

The compete page remains up when we're not actively looking for signups. Rather than collecting teams for a specific competition, the form collects team leaders' details and signs them up to the "Potential Team Leaders" mail list.

## Distribution

The form needs to be distributed to those who may be interested in competing. There are 2 primary sources for this:

- The team leaders who competed in the previous year's competition
- The "Potential Team Leaders" mail list in Mailchimp.

## Collection

From the form responses, create [a spreadsheet](./organisation.md). At this point, a few things need doing:

First, assign the team a TLA (Three-Letter Acronym). If the team has competed before, reuse their previously allocated one. If they haven't, make one up based on their institution name, ensuring it's clean and sufficiently different from other competing teams.

Additionally, ensure their rookie status is correct. If they claim they've competed before, verify it. If they claim not to have, also double check it. Because the rookie status is tied to a final prize, it's important it be correct.

## Confirmation

As kickstart gets closer, it's useful to start confirming teams and sending them relevant information ([example email](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2019/2018-10-10-place-confirmation.md)). Confirming early allows team leaders to plan and schedule transport on their end.

If the forum and IDE are being used, then create the team leader's account and send them their credentials to log in and start setting up their team(s).

When confirming their place in the competition, it's also necessary to confirm which kickstart to expect them at. At this point, ensure the [Kit Team](https://studentrobotics.org/kitbook/kit-team/logistics/kit-transport/) are aware of how many kits are needed at each kickstart venue and how many need dispatching directly to teams.
