# Mentoring

* Contact the Volunteer Coordinator asking for potential Mentors.
* A Google Form can be used to obtain the following information:
    * Confirm over 18
    * Name
    * Email address
    * Location
    * How far willing to travel to mentor
    * Roughly how often could commit to visiting a team
    * What skills do you possess making you suitable mentor
    * Previous SR experience

## Example of email sent to potential Mentors asking for volunteers in 2017

> Hello – would you like to be a Mentor for a Student Robotics team for this year’s competition?  Here’s what it involves and requirements for volunteering for this crucial role.
>
> Mentors must be 18 years old or over. They must also possess skills that will help to further the teams’ learning and understanding of engineering, science and team work. For example, a mentor may be an engineering or science undergraduate, graduate or professional (note that this example is not an exhaustive list).
>
> Each mentor should assist a team in achieving their full potential within the competition.
>
> Responsibilities
>
> 1. Assisting a team by consulting them about issues they are having, or may have, that relate to their involvement in the competition.
>
> 2. Regularly meeting with their team (this would likely need to be during or close to school hours i.e. 9am-4pm and so if you have a day job would this commitment be possible for you?)
>
> 3. Providing a report to their supervisor (their Local Team Co-ordinator) when they have visited a team.
>
> 4. Notifying their supervisor if they are unable to mentor a team for a significant period of time.
>
> There are currently five Local Team Coordinators who cover a rough geographic area of the country.  They will be responsible for you as a Mentor and will hopefully be able to arrange social events throughout the year where you can meet other Mentors.
>
> Think this is something you would like to be involved in?  We would ideally allocate a Mentor to each of the 54 teams so we need as many of you to volunteer as possible…so get involved and help guide a team to success in this year’s competition!
>
> If you would like to be considered for this role we require the following information:
>
> Name?
>
> Location (where you live/work if this is different)?
>
> How far are you willing to travel?
>
> Roughly how often could you commit to visiting a school?
>
> What skills do you possess which would make you a suitable mentor?
>
> Have you had any previous experience with SR kits/teams e.g. as a volunteer or a participant?
>
> Please confirm that you are over 18.


* Once replies obtained, make ‘Mentor Sign-Up’ spreadsheet with this info and share with LTCs so that they can review and match Mentors with their teams.

* LTCs should:
    * contact their team leaders to ask them about when, where and how often they meet to be able to match with a potential mentor (might want to produce a Google Form to streamline the information captured)
    * plot potential mentors on a map and plot the location of your teams
    * once received the details of the Team meeting times/locations etc. match up geographically close potential mentors to teams
    * enter the potential TLA by the mentor on the Mentor Sign-Up spreadsheet to identify any clashes.
    * contact potential Mentor to inform them of their matched team to confirm availability etc. with Team Leader contact info, HIGHLIGHT that mentor should only be interacting with the Team Leader as the responsible adult (i.e over 18) for the team.  DIRECT them to Page 27 of Ops Manual for further info re. being a Mentor.
    * provide the Mentor with guidance about what the role entails (our [general guidance](../volunteering/mentor-guidance.md) helps with this)
    * contact Team Leader to inform them of mentor, giving Mentor contact info.
    * check up on progress of Mentoring relationship through email updates.
