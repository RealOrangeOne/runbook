# Kickstart

## Allocating teams to kickstart events

If a venue has a fixed capacity, and more teams than this have requested it, some teams need to be redirected to other events.

When deciding this, a few factors need to be considered:

* How far is the team from any other kickstart events
* Has the team competed before
* If the team has competed before, how many competitors have they historically had
* How soon did they sign up after the competition was announced

If a team cannot get their desired event location, allow them to choose an alternative, rather than allocating them one.

## Shipping kits to those who cannot attend

After kickstart, remaining kits should be enumerated to work out which teams signed up, but did not attend an event to collect their kit.

1. Email the teams requesting they sign a Kit Disclaimer form, and explicitly confirm their address
    * [Example email from SR2020](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2020/2019-11-04-kit-shipping.md)
2. Validate the returned disclaimer form is valid, and is for this competition year
3. Update the address in the teams list if applicable
4. Pass on the TLA, address and team leader name to the Kit Team to dispatch the kit
5. Once the kit has been dispatched, send the team leader the tracking code, if available
