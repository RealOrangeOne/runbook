# Tickets and Media Consent Forms

## Media Consent Forms

Because the competition is often livestreamed, and heavily photographed, Teams are required to sign [media consent forms](https://github.com/srobo/media-consent) before they can enter the venue.

Only those 16 or over can sign the consent form for themselves. If a competitor or guest is younger than 16, a parent / guardian must sign the form on their behalf.

Teams should be [emailed](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2019/2019-03-11-competition-information.md) about the existence of media consent long before the competition, and prompted to return their signed forms to `teams@` well before the competition.

## Tickets

Once a media consent form has been signed, the signer is issued with a ticket, thereby proving they have given media consent. Tickets are non-transferable, and are single use. Tickets must be brought to the competition, where they will be [scanned](https://github.com/srobo/tickets) to gain entry.

Tickets can either be brought physically, or presented on a screen.
