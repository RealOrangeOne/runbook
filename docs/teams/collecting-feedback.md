# Collecting Feedback

At the end of a competition, it's important to collect feedback from those involved, to ensure any issues are collected and improved on for next year, but also to collect praise and understand what teams enjoyed.

We ask different questions depending on whether they're a team leader, competitor, parent / guardian or guest. It's best to base the questions on the forms sent for previous years.

These feedback forms should be sent out as close to the competition as possible (perhaps even shortly before). They're often included in the wrap-up email ([example from SR2021](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2021/2021-05-05-competition-wrap-up.md)).
