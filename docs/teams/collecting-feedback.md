# Collecting Feedback

At the end of a competition, it's important to collect feedback from those involved, to ensure any issues are collected and improved on for next year, but also to collect praise and understand what teams enjoyed.

We ask different questions depending on whether they're a team leader, competitor, parent / guardian or guest. It's best to base the questions on the forms sent for previous years.

These feedback forms should be sent out as close to the competition as possible (perhaps even shortly before). They're often included in the wrap-up email ([example from SR2021](https://github.com/srobo/team-emails/blob/master/SR2021/2021-05-05-competition-wrap-up.md)).

## Example questions

These are some of the questions we have asked in the past:

- How did you find the livestreams? (Boring - engaging)
- Of the livestreams you watched, how long did you watch them for?
- How approachable were the volunteers?
- Did you get adequate support when you needed it?
- Were the rules easy to understand?
- How fair was the game?
- What did you especially like about Student Robotics 20XX?
- What did you especially not like about Student Robotics 20XX?
- How could next year's Student Robotics competition be improved?
- If you needed information, did you know where to find it?
- How many tech days did you attend?
