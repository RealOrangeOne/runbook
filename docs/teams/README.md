# Teams

This section contains information about the support we provide for teams
entering the competition, how we get them involved and how we communicate with
them.

Generally a single person (the Team Coordinator) takes on the overall
responsibility for teams, though during the competition year it is often
advantageous to delegate to other volunteers to ensure prompt
responses to enquiries and avoid overloading a single person.
