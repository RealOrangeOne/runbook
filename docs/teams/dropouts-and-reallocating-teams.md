## Dropouts

A team may decide they no longer wish to or are unable to compete in the competition. Efforts should be made to identify any issues that are preventing the team from continuing and solutions found if possible.  If they would still like to dropout after discussion, then follow procedure below.

* Teams spreadsheet should be updated to reflect their status
* If the team has a kit, pass on their information to the Kit Team, to negotiate its return

When deciding whether to re-allocate a team, it's important to consider whether the team would have a disadvantage after having been in the competition for less time. If a team drops out long after kickstart, prefer allocating second kits to teams over inviting new teams.

If unavoidable or unfortunate circumstance then email Team Leader acknowledging drop-out, offering further assistance if applicable or suggesting that they come to the competition anyway for experience and explain procedure for Kit Return.

## To re-allocate a team

If a team drops out and a space becomes available before kickstart, the Potential Team Leaders MailChimp list should be used to find those willing to enter a team at the last minute. If a team enquired, but was too late in applying, they should take priority.

* Email offer of place (or second team place), asking to confirm contact information
* Once replied to confirm would still like to participate, [allocate the team](./allocating-teams.md)
* If before Kickstart: Find out which [kickstart](./kickstart.md) they wish to attend
* If shortly after Kickstart: email Kit Team about new team allocation, and request a kit be dispatched to them
