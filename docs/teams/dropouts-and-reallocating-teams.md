# Dropouts

Throughout a competition, teams may decide they no longer wish to compete. Depending on circumstances, we should try and encourage them to continue, understand their problems and offer them more direct support.

Update the [teams organisation](./organisation.md) spreadsheet noting that the team is no longer active.

# Reallocating

If the drop out is close enough to kickstart, allocate their place to another team which was unable to enter. If there aren't any, reach out to the teams who requested an additional team, to see if they are still interested. Reach out to teams in the order they signed up.

If the team is interested, update the [teams organisation](./organisation.md) spreadsheet with their number of teams, and ensure they are allocated an additional team on the forums / IDE.

!!!note
    When allocating additional teams, ensure the team leader is aware that separate teams should be entirely separate, competitors should only be in a single team. Just because they're from the same school, doesn't make them any less rivals.

If the team drops out shortly before the competition, we should attempt to encourage them to stay on and compete. If there is a problem that can be resolved, then this should be done.
