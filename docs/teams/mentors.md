# Mentoring

Some teams, especially weaker ones, may benefit from or desire a more direct form of mentoring. For these teams, we allocate them a dedicated mentor.

Mentors generally attend many of the teams' meetings, and so have an in-depth knowledge of the teams' strategy, design and build. This allows them to give more insightful and specific support.


## Being a mentor

!!! warning
    Mentors must be over the age of 18.

Mentors should possess skills that will help to further the teamsâ€™ learning and understanding of engineering, science and team work. For example, a mentor may be an engineering or science undergraduate, graduate or professional (note that this example is not an exhaustive list).

The time commitment for mentoring varies by team, though it is typical to spend a few hours every week or fortnight on a mentoring session. Meetings may happen virtually or in person.

## Allocating mentors

Teams should be allocated mentors based on how likely they are to benefit from it. Rookie teams should be favoured where possible.

Depending on the mentors schedule and location, mentors should be allocated to teams who are geographically close to them, or who meet at a compatible time.
