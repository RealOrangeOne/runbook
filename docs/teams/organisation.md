# Organisation

To keep track of teams, and all required information, a spreadsheet is used. The sheet is populated during [registration](./registration.md), but must be kept up-to-date during the whole competition. This sheet contains sensitive information, and so should be kept inside the Competition Team.

## Fields

- Institution name
- Team leader email
- Team leader first name
- Team leader last name
- Emergency phone number
- Desired kickstart location
- Allocated kickstart location
- Is the team a rookie?
- Did the team collect a kit at kickstart?

Some fields only relevant to teams who didn't attend kickstart:

- Has the team confirmed their address?
- Have we received their kit disclaimer form?
- Has the kit been dispatched to them?
- Have they been granted a kit loan extension?

## Public list

Openness is a core value for Student Robotics. To ensure all volunteers have access to some bits of information for teams, it can be useful to create a "public" version of the organisation list. This spreadsheet must not contain any personally-identifiable information nor potentially sensitive information (whether generally or to the competition).
