Currently SR has two arenas at the competition. Each arena is an 8x8m carpeted area surrounded by 300mm high MDF walls. For further details about the design see the rules . The following is a rough plan for arena construction. Four people are required for arena construction Materials \u00b6 Budget cord carpet - 2x 18x4m rolls and 1x 9x4m roll NEC approved low-tac double sided-tape - 5x 38mm x 50m rolls Insulating tape (for marking out - so the colour is unimportant) Arena walls XXmmxXXmm wood screws [not sure what size, will take 20mm and 30mm then update this doc afterwards] 50x 5-litre HDPE jerrycans A water supply Double-sided finger-lift tape - 1x 12mm x 50m roll White gaffer tape - 1x 50mm x 50m roll Arena wall libkoki markers Fluorescent gaffer tape - 4x 48mm x 25m rolls one each of yellow, green, orange and pink Metal crowd-control barriers Tools \u00b6 Scissors Stanley knife Tape measure (>10m highly recommended) PZ2 screwdriver 2x battery drills w. PZ2 screwdriver bits Procedure \u00b6 Mark out where the carpet will be laid on the venue floor with insulation tape. [15 mins] Lay the carpet by applying strips of NEC double sided tape to the floor and roll the carpet out onto it in sections. [1 hour] The following steps can be carried out in parallel. Two people work on each step. Mark out where the arena walls will be laid on the carpet with insulating tape. [15 mins] Fill the jerrycans with water. [15 mins] Place the arena walls onto the carpet. The wall sections are number and must be placed in the correct order so that the screw holes line up. [30 mins] Screw the wall sections together. [30 mins] Place the jerrycans on the wall feet. [15 mins] Mark out where the arena wall markers are to be stuck with insulating tape on the carpet next to the wall face. [15 mins] Apply the markers to the walls using a cross of double-sided tape and surround the edges with white gaffer tape. Take care to ensure the ordering and arena assignment (A/B) is correct. [30 mins] Mark out the corners with the fluorescent gaffer tape and write the corner number on the carpet with the tape. [15 mins] Apply the A/B markers to the outside of the arena walls. [15 mins] Place the crowd-control barrier around the arenas. [15 mins] Total construction time: 4 hours 15 mins. SR2016 Game (Sunny Side Up) Specific Set-up Plan \u00b6 The SR2016 game requires tokens to be constructed. These tokens consist of cardboard box cubes with 250mm side-length covered with libkoki markers. To assist human spectators, coloured gaffer tape is applied to the faces of the cube. Four people are required for token construction Materials \u00b6 Cardboard boxes - 36x 9\"x9\"x9\" double-wall boxes (external dimensions approx. 245mm x 254mm x 254mm) Token libkoki markers Double-sided finger-lift tape - 4x 12mm x 50m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 6x 24mm x 25m rolls Grey cloth gaffer tape - 3x 24mm x 25m rolls Fluorescent cloth gaffer tape - 12x 24mm x 25m rolls three each of yellow, green, orange and pink Tools \u00b6 Laptop running the token verification software Procedure \u00b6 There are two sets of tokens to be built. Those for arena A and those for arena B. It is extremely important that the markers for these are kept separate throughout the build process. To help with this the tokens are to be built in two batches - first those for arena A then those for arena B. To complicate matters further there are three different token nets per arena so always triple check that you have the right markers. Fold the flat-packed box into a cube. [30 sec] Use the grey tape to seal the top and bottom flaps along the seam. [30 sec] Obtain a complete set of markers (top, bottom, sides 0 through 3) all for the same arena and net (A, B or C). [30 sec] Apply a cross of double-sided tape to a side of the box. Stick the correct marker onto the box, taking care to align it in the centre of the face. Also take care to ensure that the orientation is correct relative to the other markers on the box. Repeat the above two steps until all of the markers have been stuck on the box. [10 mins] Verify the token with the verification program on the laptop, following the instructions next to the laptop. If the verification program indicates the token is correct continue, otherwise fix the problem. [1 min] Use the grey tape (use white tape if the grey has run out) to cover all 12 edges of the box and seal the marker edges. [2 mins] Apply coloured gaffer tape to each side of the box, surrounding the marker. Take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square surrounding each marker. See the marker construction cheat-sheet for the side to colour mapping. [5 mins] Apply white gaffer tape to the top and bottom of the box, surrounding the marker. Again, take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square. [2 mins] Verify the token with the verification program again. [1 min] Repeat. Setup time: 30 mins .

Add a second screwdriver to the equipment, to allow two people to be assembly simultaneously. Provide both PZ2 and PZ1 screwdrivers. Only a PZ2 screwdriver was provided in SR2017 and some of the screws turned out to have PZ1 heads. Address labels were not required as the RPi name and last few MAC octets were written on the cardboard sled. The RPis have been left on their sleds, so are ready to deploy immediately. The display mounts always have missing/incorrect screws, so make sure that we have spares available in the materials. According to the VESA FDMI spec for 75x75 and 100x100 mounts, we need M4x10mm screws (ideally with PZ2 pan head). When assembling the unicol stands, make sure that the three holes in the poles are at the top on the stands for the large displays and on the bottom for the small displays. Ensure that the pole mounts for the small screens are mounted in the orientation that allows the screen to be pivoted side-to-side, rather than up/down. This stops them from drooping during the competition. For the mounts that we have used previously, this is achieved by orienting the bracket on the monitor as an 'I' rather than an 'H'. Some of the SR screens may be missing IEC mains leads.

Libkoki Markers \u00b6 The arena marker requirements are identical to SR2016. The arena markers from SR2016 will be reused for SR2017. As a note for future purchases, it would be useful if the arena markers had a v-notch in the centre of their bottom edge to aid with alignment during arena construction. Requirements (all ranges inclusive): Type Size Arena A Arena B Notes Arena 250mm 100-127 150-177 We have all of the markers used in SR2016, but some are quite scuffed. We got two whole sets printed in SR2016, so will use the spare set as the primary markers in SR2017 with the SR2016 set as spares. Robot 100mm 128-131 178-181 We have badges from SR2016, so don't need new markers Token A 200mm 132-135 182-185 Token B 200mm 136-139 186-189 Token C 200mm 140 190 The Arena markers have been packaged up into 'A primary', 'B primary', 'A spare' and 'B spare' packs ready for deployment on the set-up day. The token markers for arena A and B can be found in game-markers.git (A-TOKEN* and B-TOKEN*). These have been combined into a single PDF in arena.git using the command pdfjoin -o sr2017_token_240x240.pdf /path/to/game-markers.git/SR2017/comp/*TOKEN* . This PDF contains a single sides-worth of markers, meaning that 12 copies are required to allow us to construct both a primary and spare set of tokens for each arena. The markers are to be ordered from Stormpress on 270gsm synthetic media (as specified in the README.txt file in arena.git). Before requesting a quote from Stormpress, I got someone else to sanity check the PDFs. Arena labels \u00b6 Each arena has 'A' and 'B' labels applied to the outside of the walls. We need 16 of each label (4 per wall). All of the 'A' and 'B' labels from SR2016 are suitable for use in SR2017 and have been packaged up ready for deployment on the set-up day. Game props \u00b6 The SR2017 game has 9 'token' props per arena. These tokens consist of cardboard boxes with libkoki markers attached to each face. All markers on a single token are the same, but each token has a different marker number. There are 4 tokens with marker numbers in the 'A' range, 4 tokens with marker numbers in the 'B' range and a single token with a 'C' marker. Each arena has two full sets of tokens, a primary and a spare set. The rules specify the size of each token as a cube with a side length of 245\u00b110mm. This size was chosen to match the nominal dimensions of a double wall 9 inch cardboard box. 4 packs of 10 of UKPackaging ref 15759 are to be ordered (36 boxes required). The tokens are not associated with corners/robots in any way this year, so their colouring should not imply any association. However, the tokens needs to be easily identifiable as 'A', 'B' and 'C' for linesmen and spectators. For this reason the tokens will be red (A tokens, Apple), yellow (non-fluorescent) (B tokens, Banana) and white/brown combo (C tokens, Coconut). Each token will take 3.6m of 48mm wide tape to cover all 12 edges. There are 16 A and 16 B tokens, requiring ~58m of red and ~58m of yellow tape respectively. There are 4 C tokens, requiring ~7.5m of white tape and ~7.5m of brown tape. All tape from Gaffertape.com Industrial Grade/Cloth Tape Carpet \u00b6 For the last few years we have used 'budget cord carpet' either in blue or red (depending on availability) from More For Your Floor . Previously we have ordered 2x 18x4m lengths and 1x 9x4m length, however we cut the 18m lengths in half. Since they charge per square metre, we can just order 5x 9x4m lengths for the same price and save our time cutting it up. Arena walls \u00b6 The arena walls are 300mm tall made out of 9mm thick waterproof MDF in 1.144m sections. There are 7 sections per side of the arena, giving an internal size of 7.999m (7x1.144 - 0.009). Each section has two feet that stick out on the outside of the arena. These feet have water-filled 5l plastic jerry cans placed on them for ballast. The wall sections are held together with 3.5x25mm screws (2 screws per section for a total of 56 screws). We already own all of the wall sections, all of the screws and all of the jerry cans from previous years. Network requirements \u00b6 There is a private LAN, the 'arena network', that connects all of the computers around the arenas, the shepherding area and the score entry area. This LAN requires points at: Each corner of each arena (8 off) requires two ethernet points that can reach up to 2m in the air from the floor. The shepherd area requires two ethernet points The score entry area requires two ethernet points (provide 4) The downstairs 'outside' display requires one ethernet point The upstairs 'outside' display requires one ethernet point. This will be connected to the Newbury network, it will only have internet access and not access to the rest of the arena network. This LAN connects to the Newbury network to get internet access. The connection to the Newbury network is via a NAT router. The NAT router also needs to provide DHCP leases with fixed hostnames (and provide DNS lookup of these hostnames) for the following MAC addresses: b8:27:eb:89:e9:e0 pi-outside-0 b8:27:eb:51:84:16 pi-shepherding-1 b8:27:eb:e9:ec:98 pi-outside-2 b8:27:eb:2e:84:e4 pi-arena-A0 b8:27:eb:ec:0e:80 pi-arena-A1 b8:27:eb:e4:7a:ef pi-arena-A2 b8:27:eb:ed:f2:77 pi-arena-A3 b8:27:eb:be:ce:73 pi-arena-B0 b8:27:eb:b9:2b:29 pi-arena-B1 b8:27:eb:3c:0b:c5 pi-arena-B2 b8:27:eb:eb:9a:17 pi-arena-B3 b8:27:eb:69:f2:04 pi-staging-11 [unknown] compbox-2017 The NAT router is a GLi GL-AR300M with the following changes made to the factory default configuration: Hostname set to littleblackrouter SSID set to sr-arena-net WPA2 password changed (password written on the device) Web interface/root password changed (password written on the device) Static leases added for the above listed MAC address/hostnames Power requirements \u00b6 Power is required in the following locations: Each arena corner (8 off): 4 (from RTSS) + 4 (ITR 4-way plugged into 1 of RTSS) sockets Shepherding area: 7 sockets Score entry area: 10 sockets Downstairs 'outside' display: 4 sockets Upstairs 'outside' display: 4 sockets Display requirements \u00b6 Each arena corner (8 off) requires one 24\" screen on a unicol stand The shepherding area requires two 24\" screens on desk stands The 'outside' displays require two 32\" screens on unicol stands (one for downstairs and one for upstairs) Table and chair requirements \u00b6 The staging area requires 9 'small' (4ft x 2ft approx) or 6 'large' (6/8ft x 2ft approx) trestle tables. The shepherding area requires 2 'small' or 1 'large' trestle tables and 4 chairs. The score entry area requires 4 'small' or 3 'large' trestle tables and 6 chairs. We need to borrow these off of Newbury (along with the tables and chairs for the pits - see Pit Manager docs). Crowd barrier requirements \u00b6 To surround the two arenas and the staging are we require 50x 2m crowd barriers. Newbury have these already and we can borrow them. Staging area requirements \u00b6 As well as the tables noted in the table and chair requirements section, the staging area requires four 48mm x 25m rolls of fluorescent gaffer tape (one each of yellow, green, orange and pink) and one 50mm x 50m roll of white gaffer. It also requires some printed 'Arena A' and 'Arena B' signs to stick on the desks to clearly identify the staging bays for each arena. Tape order \u00b6 Order the following: Red cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls Yellow cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Brown cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Grey cloth gaffer tape - 2x 48mm x 25m rolls Red cloth gaffer tape - 1x 24mm x 25m rolls Yellow cloth gaffer tape - 1x 24mm x 25m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 1x 24mm x 25m rolls NEC approved low-tac double sided-tape - 3x 38mm x 50m rolls Insulating tape (any colour) White gaffer tape - 2x 50mm x 50m roll Black gaffer tape - 4x 50mm x 50m roll Fluorescent gaffer tape - 8x 48mm x 25m rolls (two each of yellow, green, orange and pink) (We already have ~6 rolls of double-sided finger lift tape, ~4 rolls of NEC double-sided tape, ~1 roll of each colour of fluorescent tape and ~1 roll of white gaffer tape.)

Display Assembly \u00b6 Two people are required for screen assembly Materials \u00b6 Outside display floor plan (outside-display-floor-0.pdf and outside-display-floor-2.pdf from comp-floorplans.git) 10x unicol stands 10x 24\" screens with HDMI inputs (we own 6) 2x 32\" screens with HDMI inputs 8x vesa pole mounts 2x unicol mounts for 32\" screens 12x 4-way extension leads (UK plug and UK sockets) 12x raspberry pis 12x raspberry pi PSUs 12x HDMI leads A piece of cardboard to make sled for raspberry pis 1x roll of 50mm x 50m black gaffer tape Roll of address labels Pen Tools \u00b6 1x PZ2 screwdriver Set of metric hex keys Scissors or knife Procedure \u00b6 It is very important that the correct raspberry pis are attached to the correct type of screen. The name of each raspberry pi will be indicated, but may not be marked on the raspberry pi itself. If it is not marked on the raspberry pi itself, use some address labels to mark them appropriately. Assemble 8 of the unicol stands with a single pole and 2 with both poles. [30 mins] Attach the pole mounts to the back of 8 of the 24\" screens. [30 mins] Attach the 8 24\" screens to the 8 single-pole unicol stands. [30 mins] Attach the 2 unicol mounts for the 32\" screens to the 2 dual-pole unicol stands. [10 mins] Attach the 2 32\" screens to the 2 dual-pole unicol stands. [10 mins] Attach the desk stands to the remaining 2 24\" screens. [10 mins] On the back of all 12 screens attach a 4-way extension lead with gaffer tape. [30 mins] On the back of all 12 screens attach a raspberry pi with a piece of cardboard, as an insulating sled, and with gaffer tape. Observe the correct mapping and do not cover the label applied in step 1: [30 mins] Raspberry pis marked with 'arena-A' or 'arena-B' go onto the 8 24\" screens on single-pole unicol stands Raspberry pis marked with 'outside-0' or 'outside-2' go onto the 2 32\" screens Raspberry pis marked with 'shepherding' or 'staging' go onto the 2 24\" desk mount screens Plug all of the raspberry pis into their corresponding display with HDMI leads. [10 mins] Plug all of the raspberry pis into the 4-way extension lead with their PSUs. [10 mins] Plug each screen into its 4-way extension lead with the appropriate lead (supplied with the screen). [10 mins] Work with Competition Software Coordinator to test that each screen functions as expected. Note that the screen must be powered up (and the HDMI cable connected to the raspberry pi) before powering up the raspberry pi, otherwise it may not detect the screen. [30 mins] Place and plug in (both power and network) the two 'outside' displays (the ones not in the arena or staging area). Refer to the floor plans for the positions. [15 mins] Total assembly time: 4 hours 15 mins. SR2017 Game (Easy as ABC) Prop Construction \u00b6 The SR2016 game requires tokens to be constructed. These tokens consist of cardboard box cubes with 250mm side-length covered with libkoki markers. To assist human spectators, coloured gaffer tape is applied to the faces of the cube. Four people are required for token construction Materials \u00b6 Cardboard boxes - 36x 9\"x9\"x9\" double-wall boxes (external dimensions approx. 245mm x 254mm x 254mm) Token libkoki markers Double-sided finger-lift tape - 4x 12mm x 50m rolls Red cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls Yellow cloth gaffer tape - 3x 48mm x 25m rolls White cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Brown cloth gaffer tape - 1x 48mm x 25m rolls Grey cloth gaffer tape - 2x 48mm x 25m rolls Tools \u00b6 Scissors Procedure \u00b6 There are two sets of tokens to be built. Those for arena A and those for arena B. To make things simple the tokens will be constructed in two phases: arena A tokens followed by arena B tokens. Each token has six of the same marker number and the orientation of the markers is irrelevant. Fold the flat-packed box into a cube. [30 sec] Use the grey tape to seal the top and bottom flaps along the seam. [30 sec] Obtain a complete set of markers (all marker numbers the same). [30 sec] Apply a cross of double-sided tape to a side of the box. Stick a marker onto the box, taking care to align it in the centre of the face. Repeat the above two steps until all of the markers have been stuck on the box. [6 mins] Get a second person to verify that all of the markers on the box have the same number (as noted in the small grey text in the bottom left of each marker). [1 min] Use the coloured tape (as specified below) to cover all 12 edges of the box and seal the marker edges. Take care to ensure that it is outside of the grey square surrounding each marker. [6 mins] Use red tape for 'A' tokens Use yellow tape for 'B' tokens Use white/brown tape for 'C' tokens (use white on some edges and brown on others - make it look coconut-y) Verify the token with the verification program again. [1 min] Repeat. Setup time: 30 mins . Construction time per token: ~16mins . Total construction time (with four people): ~3 hours . Final Day Arena Changeover \u00b6 On the final day of the competition we change to a single arena (arena A) for quarter finals, semi finals and final. There is very little time to perform this changeover between the final heat and the first quarter final. Six people are required for arena changeover (2 guards, 4 workers) Tools \u00b6 2x battery drills w. PZ2 screwdriver bits Procedure \u00b6 Instruct the two workers to stop anyone other than the four workers from entering the changeover area. The following two tasks happen in parallel (two people per task): Remove the screws joining the arena wall sections along the side of arena B next to arena A and 3 sections down each side. Take care to only remove the screws on one side of the joint (ask Rich which side). [2 mins] Remove the jerry cans from the feet of the walls being unscrewed and unplug the power and network cables from the two displays in the corners of arena B next to arena A. [2 mins] Move all of the unscrewed wall sections to the other side of arena B. [1 min] The following two tasks happen in parallel: Pull back the unused network and power cabling to the other side of arena B, taking care to leave the network and power cabling running to arena A. [1 min] Wheel the unplugged corner displays to the other side of arena B. [1 min] Reposition the crowd barrier along the exposed edge of arena A and partially along the exposed staging area. [2 min] .

If you are a team competing in Student Robotics, you probably want our main website . This page details the procedures to be following in the event of an incident occurring during the competition. Incidents are split into 2 types; minor and major. What constitutes an incident is rather unpredictable, and as such is not fully defined. Common sense should prevail in determining the nature and severity of the incident. This procedure is superseded by any requirements of the venue, e.g. in the event of a fire follow the venues' fire evacuation procedure. Minor Incidents \u00b6 A minor incident is anything that needs some kind of response but has minimal impact on the event. Examples may be; A competitor has twisted their ankle on a stairwell, Infrastructure cabling has become damaged and poses a hazard. Procedure here is simple; Notify relevant coordinator, Follow their instructions Major Incidents \u00b6 A major incident is anything that causes a significant impact on the event as a whole. Examples might include; Accident requiring significant first aid, Battery failure renders access to an area unsafe If first aid is required the First Aid Provider should always be notified first. Following that, as with minor incidents, the reaction should be to notify the relevant coordinator and follow their instructions. Stopping the competition \u00b6 A major incident may call for the competition to be stopped. This may be at the end of a current match or in the middle of a match. Due to the impact of stopping the competition, ability to do so is restricted to the following roles: Health and Safety Coordinator, Event Coordinator, Head Judge, Majority decision from Trustees. Stopping the competition will be indicated by a call over the radio of \"This is role ; stop the competition.\" This call should be repeated at least once, and every minute or so until acknowledged by one of the other aforementioned roles. At this point the following should occur; Matches stop, Power tools area to be vacated, Battery charging to be turned off, Competitors, Team Leaders, and members of the public should be asked to remain in their current location, Competitors to be asked to stop testing on robots. The aim of these is to prevent any other issues occurring whilst the current incident is being dealt with, and to prevent attendees from getting in the way of the handling the incident. Shift in roles \u00b6 In the event of a major incident, the Head Shepherd becomes the point of contact between the main radio network and the shepherd radio network. They are also responsible for managing the Shepherds and Badgers. To avoid confusion, all radios should remain on their normal network. Shepherds become responsible for managing competitors, team leaders, and members of the public. The nearest roving helper should shutdown the power tools area, and remain there to ensure it remains unused. All other roles should remain in location and await further instructions. Further instructions will be given when appropriate, and should not be requested. Stopping matches \u00b6 With stopping matches, the Head Judge should make a decision about whether to stop the match part way through, or to stop the matches once the current match is finished. This decision should be based on the proximity of the incident to the arena, and any further information received regarding the incident. If the match is stopped at the end, the Marshals should score the match as normal, and then hit the power cut off on each robot. The arena should then be vacated and left as-is. If the match is stopped immediately, if safe to do so, the Marshals should hit the power cut off on each robot, and then vacate the arena. In either scenario; the Badgers should ask all competitors to leave the staging area. Robots to remain where they are, power cut offs to be hit. Resuming/cancelling the competition \u00b6 Resuming the competition requires the consent of all involved in stopping it.

Head Match Scorer \u00b6 Responsible for managing the marshals and score entry which they may bring in as their only subordinate roles. As head match scorer you should station yourself near the arena/staging area to ensure any questions with regards to scoring can be asked. Note that this role is not about making decisions related to the interpretations of the rules. That is the responsibility of the Judge . Match Marshal \u00b6 Responsible for being in the arena, saving robots and recording the end-state of matches. They may not bring in any subordinate volunteers. You MUST read the rules before starting this role, as you will be enforcing them. Especially make sure you understand the scoring rules (i.e. what counts as 'in' a zone), and how the arena should be laid out. For convenience, we have listed the most important regulations and rules for a match scorer below, marshals should be trained on this before they start. In this role you will work in the arena with a partner. You will be the only ones allowed in the arena during matches, however it is very important that you do not obstruct any robot or its vision, (especially by casting shadows over markers). Your responsibilities are: Recording the state of the arena at the exact end of the match (see 'Scoring'). Ensuring robots start in the correct corner, and are entirely within their starting zone. Ensuring no team members touch a robot after it has first moved. (see 'Teams touching robots'). Switching off robots when a team requests that you do so, or if they do not automatically turn off after a match ends. Resetting the arena by moving props (tokens, for example) back to the correct place after you and your partner have both recorded the end-state of the match. There is no mechanism for delaying the matches, so please request extra help if you are struggling to make the deadlines. You are not responsible for: Making sure a match starts with the correct number of teams -- that is down to the shepherds. Summary of the most important rules & regulations for SR2019: \u00b6 A token is considered to be \u2018in\u2019 a zone if either: Three corners of the token are in contact with the floor area inside the zone. Corners touching tape are not in the zone, tokens on Robots, or standing on their edges are not in the zone. The token is touching only other tokens (not robots, not the floor), which themselves are 'in'. A robot is considered to be 'in' a zone if: The exact center of the flagpole is above the zone (if it's directly above the coloured tape, it's not in the zone). Scoring \u00b6 Both marshals will be given a score sheet on a clipboard, which you must both individually fill in fully by the end of the match. Don't worry! You won't be calculating any actual scores whist doing this, we have a program to calculate the actual scores. All you need to do is record the state of the arena as it is at the exact end of the match. Anything that happens after the match has ended must not be recorded, and the arena must not be changed until both scorers have finished. Teams are not allowed to enter the arena to collect their robots until after scoring has finished. Once you have finished scoring, you should compare your score-sheet to that of the other marshal in order to pick up any mistakes. One of you should then drop both of the completed score sheets at the score entry desk which will be near the arenas. You must return promptly to the arena in case you need to be found for further scoring questions, and begin resetting the arena for the next match. Teams touching robots \u00b6 Teams must not be allowed in the arena during a match. It is the responsibility of the team members to place their robot in the start zone before the match starts. If a robot moves off before the match starts (aside from minor servo-resetting arm movements) teams are allowed to switch off their robot, reset it and start again. However, if the mis-started robot touches any arena prop then they should be immediately disqualified (there is a checkbox on the score sheet). Once the robot start button has been pressed and the match has started, teams are not allowed to interact with their robots until after scoring has taken place. Turning off robots \u00b6 Be sure to turn off robots if they continue moving after the end of a match. Make sure you know where the off button is for all robots before the matches. There are three situations where robots should be turned off before the end of a match: If the team members indicate that they wish to do so (by \"throwing in the towel\"). By doing so, the team forfeits the match, which should be recorded in the score sheets as a disqualification. When a robot is causing significant damage to itself or another robot, i.e. Mashing into another robot, stopping it from being able to function, or dragging it around without being able to be freed, overheating a motor by stalling against a wall. It's up to you to decide which robot should be switched off, but their match shouldn't be forfeited. If any damage seems intentional, please report it to the head judge. A checklist for robot damage is available below. When a robot is causing a health and safety risk, i.e. by exposing its battery to puncture damage, or overheating a motor by stalling it against a wall. In this case their match shouldn't be forfeited. If you have any questions you may first ask the head match scorer and secondly the judge. Template Arena Setup Checklist \u00b6 Props (e.g: tokens) in the arena aren't damaged. If they are, swap them out with the spares. The tokens in the arena are intended for that arena -- this can be established by reading the grey text printed on each marker on the token. If there is more than one arena then the markers on the sides of any tokens will have the name of the arena as part of the text in the bottom left of the marker. There must be the correct number of tokens of each type in the arena. The precise configuration depends on the game, though the per-year version of this checklist should be explicit about what's needed (and not rely on volunteers remembering the rules) Each token is placed on a suitable token starting positions that are marked out on the arena floor. Where possible these should be colour-coordinated. Robot Damage Checklist \u00b6 If the damage is intentional, seek the judge. If the damage is unintentional: If a robot mashes into another robot, but only briefly, leaving both robots free to move (including situations in which, say, one robot has a fragile, flaily arm that gets snapped off in the collision) then you must leave the robots to continue -- the teams are aware that accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable. If a robot mashes into another robot, and becomes intertwined in a way that it is causing damage to the robot, then at least one of the robots must be switched off, depending on which robot caused the damage, but the scores are not necessarily forfeited in this case. Match Score Entry \u00b6 Responsible for receiving match states from the marshals, checking them, and entering them into the competition software. In the role of score entry, you will be stationed at a desk near to the arena/staging area. There should always be two people responsible for match score entry, one using the keyboard and one to resolve disputes and ensure that values are entered correctly. Two score sheets per match will be given to you by the match marshals. The steps to perform are as follows: Receive both score sheets from the marshals Check the sheets match, if they don't then one of you needs to talk to the match marshals to resolve the discrepancy (see below) Enter the scores into the computer; typically one of you would enter the scores and the other check that they match the paper sheets File the score sheet in a folder Discrepancy in score sheets \u00b6 There are two score sheets for every match. It's likely that there may be a discrepancy between the sheets. If that's the case, one match score entry volunteer should speak to the marshals to try to find the correct state. If you have any questions, speak to the head match scorer.

Roles \u00b6 Here is a description of the roles related to shepherding. Head Shepherd \u00b6 Responsible for managing the shepherds which they may bring in as their only subordinate role. Work with the Arena Manager to define the match staging area Check and report volunteer arrival. Assign volunteers to roles. Brief volunteers. Supervise shepherds and adjust shepherding procedures where necessary. Notably: consider whether the \"roving shepherd\" and \"timekeeper\" roles are needed for the venue. It was noted during SR2019 that it wasn't clear that these roles provided much additional benefit given the layout of the venue and having only a single arena respectively. Debrief roving shepherds to record locations of teams bases to then pass on to the next roving shepherd. They should also check for any immediately obvious Health and Saftey issues (blocking fire exit, walkway etc.). Shepherd \u00b6 Responsible for finding teams and ensuring they make it to their matches. They report to the Head Shepherd and may not create further subordinate roles. Below is a description of the various tasks shepherds might be assigned. You will receive your assignment to one of the roles from the Head Shepherd. At different stages of the competition (initial matches or finals) additional temporary tasks will be necessary. Team shepherds \u00b6 Each team shepherd is responsible for notifying teams in their zone when it is time to move to the staging area. They will be notified via radio by the timekeeper when it is time to do so (note that this time may vary by zone, meaning shepherds responsible for zones further away from the arena might be told to fetch earlier). Each team shepherd is assigned a colour and is responsible for all teams whose bays are in the zone of the same colour as shown in the shepherding layout map. Furthermore, they will receive a printout of the match schedule which will show which teams need to be fetched for which match with teams under their responsibility coloured in in the respective colour. We ask that shepherds notify the head shepherd immediately if they find any changes/errors in layout or colouring of their match schedule. Once a shepherd has been told to fetch all teams under their responsibility for a certain match, they have to make sure each team is told within 2 minutes to give teams enough time to make their way to the staging area. For matches where a particular shepherd has to fetch many teams (more than 4 generally), we recommend starting the process a bit earlier. The shepherd can request from the timekeeper via radio to get the fetching signal a bit earlier in this case if they would find this helpful. If a team is not in their pit, team shepherds will notify the head shepherd who will then dispatch the roving shepherds to search for the team if necessary (they could in theory already be at staging). Timekeeper \u00b6 The responsibility of the timekeeper is to be aware of the schedule and assist the shepherds in the other roles. More specifically, they should watch the shepherding screen and notify the team shepherds via radio when it is time for them to fetch their teams. The timekeeper should also notify the other shepherds of any updates or changes of schedule. If it seems like the timing does not work out (teams waiting for a long time for staging or teams arriving too late for staging) the timekeeper should discuss an update of the fetching schedule with the head shepherd. Guard \u00b6 The responsibility of the guard is to open and close the staging area at appropriate times and control entry to this area. More specifically the guard should not allow anyone into the staging area unless they are a blueshirt or staging for the next match. Only one person from each team is allowed in the staging area and they must wear a high-vis vest showing their team name, indicating that they have passed the safety test. When letting a team (=person with a robot) into the staging area the guard should tell them which corner they will stage for, ideally mentioning the colour and approximate location of the staging desk if possible. We recommend that the guard keeps a record of which teams have already been admitted for a particular match. If the guard sees a team leaving the staging area with robot markers still attached to their robot, she should request that the team return the markers before leaving the staging area. Badgers \u00b6 The responsibility of the badgers is to supervise the staging as well as to hand out and return robot badges and USB-keys. More specifically, the badgers should make sure that teams follow the direction of travel through the staging area. Once the teams have entered staging the badgers then hand out the robot badges and match keys to the teams, making sure that a team has staged in the correct slot and is receiving the correct badges. The teams leaving the arena should be advised to place their robots on the destaging desks for badge and USB key removal. The badgers need to collect the badges and keys and sort them, ready to be handed out in the next round of staging. The badgers need to ensure that teams do not leave the staging area with markers or USB-keys. The badgers should also clear any items left on the staging tables at this point to prepare for the next round of staging. Roving Shepherd \u00b6 The responsibility of the roving shepherd is to sweep the venue and look for teams that are not in their pits. Teams are often known to set up 'bases' away from their pits, and the roving shepherd will be responsible for curating a list of these bases, to aid in the searching for teams that are not in their pits. The roving shepherd will be notified of teams that need to be found via radio, they will then check if they have a known base. If they do they'll proceed to it to try and find the team. If the team does not have a known base or is not there, the roving shepherd will walk through each floor of the venue in an attempt to locate them. The Roving Shepherd is not required to find every missing team, purely do a best effort sweep of the venue. If a team can not be found they will notify the Head Shepherd immediately. The Roving Shepherd will receive a printout of the match schedule which will show which teams need to be fetched for each match. We ask that shepherds notify the head shepherd immediately if they find any changes/errors in layout or colouring of their match schedule. Communication \u00b6 Shepherd's will communicative via radio with a fallback option of Slack if for some reason radios stop working. While Radios will require brief volunteer training, it means that our primary communication method is not reliant on the venue's WiFi, volunteers having devices to view slack on, or volunteers using their own personal mobile data.","title":"Shepherding"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#shepherding","text":"The purpose of the shepherding team is to ensure that teams have the best chance possible of attending all of their matches, by getting them through staging before the start of their match.","title":"Shepherding"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#roles","text":"Here is a description of the roles related to shepherding.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"competition/matches/shepherding/#head-shepherd","text":"Responsible for managing the shepherds which they may bring in as their only subordinate role.

Teams are often known to set up 'bases' away from their pits, and the roving shepherd will be responsible for curating a list of these bases, to aid in the searching for teams that are not in their pits. The roving shepherd will be notified of teams that need to be found via radio, they will then check if they have a known base. If they do they'll proceed to it to try and find the team. If the team does not have a known base or is not there, the roving shepherd will walk through each floor of the venue in an attempt to locate them. The Roving Shepherd is not required to find every missing team, purely do a best effort sweep of the venue. If a team can not be found they will notify the Head Shepherd immediately. The Roving Shepherd will receive a printout of the match schedule which will show which teams need to be fetched for each match.

A piece of paper with the team's TLA is stuck on each side of the card. Table and Chair Requirements \u00b6 Each pit requires a single 2x6ft or 2x8ft 'large' trestle table and 6 chairs.

Safety \u00b6 The biggest risk of damage or injury is from the banana plugs coming unplugged from the charger. These are the red and black plugs that go into the side of the charger. All of the chargers should have the cables cable-tied to the charger to make it difficult to remove these plugs. Under no circumstances should these red and black plugs be unplugged from the chargers. The batteries themselves have many built-in safety features and, unless abused, are completely safe. All batteries undergoing charging must be placed inside a fireproof charging bag. In the extremely unlikely event of a fire due to a battery DO NOT attempt to tackle the fire - the batteries contain a flammable metal (Lithium) which cannot be safely tackled by most fire extinguishers. If at any point you have any doubts about safety, immediately summon the Health & Safety officer over the radio. Procedures \u00b6 Swapping a team's battery - Helpdesk \u00b6 Teams will bring discharged batteries to helpdesk and require a replacement charged battery. A Battery Charging volunteer should receive the discharged battery from the team and place it a battery bag in the discharged battery box. A charged battery should be removed from a battery bag in the the charged battery box and handed to the team. Do not allow teams to take batteries themselves - we want to prevent them from hoarding batteries. Swapping batteries - Shuffling \u00b6 One of the volunteers that is running the battery charging station will periodically have to go and get discharged batteries from the helpdesk, simultaneously dropping off charged batteries. Helpdesk may also contact them over radio to do it sooner. The general schedule will go as follows: Charged batteries should be taken to the helpdesk and put into a fire-proof bag in the charged batteries box. Discharged and damaged batteries should be taken from the fire-proof bag in the discharged batteries box to the battery charging station. Any batteries that were marked as damaged by the helpdesk (using red tape) should be inspected and placed into their own fire-proof bag in the damaged battery box if they are damaged. Charging a discharged battery - Battery Charging Station \u00b6 It's important that the battery charging station should never be left unsupervised. For this reason, we assign this role to 2 volunteers if the battery charging station isn't right next to helpdesk. If you want to be in the group photo on Sunday, please make sure you disconnect all batteries and leave them in their fire-proof bags before leaving the position. All of the battery chargers will be set-up and ready to use. Before a battery is connected, the screen must display LiPo BALANCE 2.2A 11.1V(3S) . If it displays anything other than this, please do not use it and contact helpdesk. Batteries are charged as follows: Check that the battery is not physically damaged. There should be no splits or tears in the body of the battery, no nicks in the wire insulation, no exposed wire and the battery should not be so swollen that it is no longer squidgy. There will be a couple of example batteries at the Battery Charging station to compare to. if the battery is damaged, tape over the yellow XT60 connector with red tape and place it in the damaged battery box. If the battery is not damaged, plug the yellow XT60 connector into the charger cable and the white balance connector into the 4-pin socket on the side of the charger. Place the battery in the charging bag next to the charger. Hold down the Start/Enter button for about 3 seconds until the screen displays R:3SER S:3SER CONFIRM(ENTER) . If both numbers are not 3 then disconnect the battery and summon the Health and Safety officer. If the display is as expected, press Start/Enter to commence charging. After about 1 hour the battery should complete charging - the screen will display a charge complete message. Simply disconnect the battery from the charger and place it in the charged battery box. If at any point throughout the charging cycle the charger indicates an issue (e.g. a timeout, capacity or cable error), disconnect the battery from the charger, apply a piece of red tape to the yellow XT60 connector on the battery and place it in the damaged battery box. Inevitably there will be a small number of faulty chargers. If you suspect that a particular charger is faulty (lots of batteries fail to charge on it), disconnect it from its power supply, apply red tape to its yellow XT60 connector and place it in the damaged battery box.","title":"Battery Charging"},{"location":"competition/team-support/battery-charging/#battery-charging","text":"We (Student Robotics) manage the charging of all batteries at the competition.

Volunteers are expected to advise teams in a similar fashion to mentoring - that is they should not tell teams what to do, but offer advice and guidance. The volunteers also help with kit related issues that may or may not be caused by a problem with the kit. It is the responsibility of the Helpdesk volunteers to assess teams' problems and, if necessary, swap out bits of kit hardware. In some situations teams may need to be put in contact with a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help diagnose and fix issues.

Procedures \u00b6 Almost all of Helpdesk's operations are covered by the following procedures. Handling of all requests \u00b6 Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue a Helpdesk Volunteer must fill in their TLA and a single-sentence description of the issue on an Issue Form. When the issue has been resolved a single sentence description of the resolution must be written on the form. This is primarily for analytical purposes so that we can improve the operation of Helpdesk in future years. Whenever a team comes to Helpdesk with an issue that cannot be solved instantly their TLA and a very brief (couple of words) summary of the problem must be written on a post-it note and stuck up on a board of current issues. This ensures that no problems get dropped while they are being investigated. When the issue is resolved the post-it note can be thrown away. If it appears that a particular post-it has remained on the board for an extended period of time and there has been no obvious activity to resolve the issue then a volunteer should be dispatched to the team to see if it's still a problem. Handling of requests for robot safety checks \u00b6 The robots require safety checking before they are allowed to compete in the competition. Teams will not be given their hi-viz vest until their robot has passed the safety check procedure. Helpdesk volunteers should direct teams enquiring about safety checks to the Health & Safety Coordinator. Handling of general robot development requests \u00b6 Many teams will come to Helpdesk requesting help with the development of their robot or, more likely, help using the Student Robotics kit and associated software. As mentioned earlier, Helpdesk volunteers are not expected to tell teams what to do, but rather offer advice. Helpdesk volunteers should strive to answer questions about the use of the kit and software. Some queries may require a volunteer to visit the team in their pit to observe behaviour in situ. This must only be done by a Helpdesk volunteer if it will leave no fewer than two volunteers actively manning Helpdesk. If it is not possible for a Helpdesk volunteer to visit a team then a Roving Helper should be summoned, via radio if necessary. In some rare situations it may be necessary to request the assistance of a person with more in-depth knowledge of the kit to help solve an issue. This should only be done if the issue is non-trivial, Here is a list of people to contact for further help: List for SR2019: Electronic Hardware Rob Gilton IDE Peter Law Python API Peter Law Rob Gilton Handling suspected damaged kit requests \u00b6 If a team comes to Helpdesk with a suspicion of some of the Student Robotics kit being damaged then the following procedure should be followed: Request that the team take a freshly charged battery and see if the problem persists. Request that the team tries swapping the USB and power cables to the device in question, where applicable. If the kit contains multiple of the device in question (e.g. USB hub, motor board), request that the team tries swapping it with the other one in the kit. Request that the team tests the device in question with a very simple code project that only attempts to control that one device. If all previous steps indicate that the device is probably faulty then continue with the kit swap procedure. Swapping out kit \u00b6 After determining that a piece of kit is most likely faulty it must be swapped with a working spare. Helpdesk has a supply of spare kit. To swap a piece of kit please fill in a SR2019 Kit Swap Form and follow the instructions on there. Since there is a limited quantity of spare kit, all attempts must be made to verify that the issue being observed is not caused by something else. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Saturday evening \u00b6 Some teams may wish to work on their robot on Saturday night and will therefore require batteries, a charger, a charger PSU and a battery bag. If a team requests these items, note down their TLA and the part codes of the five items on the 'Overnight Battery Loan Form' sheet and give them the parts. On Sunday morning one helpdesk volunteer must ensure that all of the parts listed on this sheet are collected from the teams and returned to the battery charging station, and marked as returned on the form. Handling requests for batteries/chargers/bags on Sunday evening \u00b6 Some teams have been granted permission to keep the kit for a little while after the competition. To be able to make use of the kit they will require batteries, chargers, and bags. They MUST NOT be given any of these items from helpdesk. They will receive these items at the 'Kit Return Desk' when they leave. All teams must go to the Kit Return Desk, regardless of whether they are returning their kit or not, as that is where teams keeping kit will receive all the needed items. Handling requests for flag fittings \u00b6 Teams may request a pipe connector to use on their robot for the purpose of attaching the robot flags. As we have a limited supply, make sure that you only let each team only take one, so that they can't keep coming back for more. Also, please show teams how to remove the fittings, as they are very strong and need to be released in the correct way (Press down on the center ring) Frequently Asked Questions \u00b6 Based on issues handled in previous years, the following may be helpful: Key phrase Resolution \"Failed to dequeue buffer Assertion 'frame != ((void*0)' failed\" There was a problem with the webcam. Make sure it's plugged in. Make sure the webcam is plugged directly into the brain board (not via a USB hub). If the problem keeps occurring, try swapping out the webcam (following the procedure).

How the competition runs \u00b6 Student Robotics features a series of league matches, then knockout rounds seeded by league scores. The schedule (on the website; see above link) defines when league matches will be for your team. You are responsible for bringing your robot to the arena, and taking part in the match: You must arrive at the competition staging area (next to the arenas, see map) with your robot at least 2 minutes before your match starts. Only your designated \u201crobot wrangler\u201d may enter the staging area. They must be wearing a high vis jacket identifying your team. You will receive this jacket once your robot has been checked to be compliant with the regulations in the rules. In the staging area, a special USB flash disk will be present to tell the robot which corner it starts in. You will need to insert this into your robot before powering on. Robot wranglers should turn your robot on before it enters the arena, so that it is ready to start on time. The match will begin regardless of whether your robot is ready. Robots are started by the team member pressing the start button on the power board. Once pressed, the team member should step back to the edge of the crowd barrier. You may only enter the arena when given permission to do so by a match scoring official. If you wish to resign from a match whilst it is in play, you may signal to a match scoring official that you wish to \u201cthrow in the towel\u201d.

This means that the crimper role will be performed directly by reception staff and there will be no secondary role Crimping staff are responsible for operating wristband crimpers, to securely attach wristbands to the wrists of competition attendees. Everyone permitted through reception will be given a loose wristband: crimpers stand behind reception and crimp the wristband once an attendee is allowed in. (If someone re-enters the competition with an already crimped wristband, no need to crimp them again). Upon crimping, inform the person that they need to have the wristband on for BOTH days of the competition. Training will be available from jmorse on the morning of each day; don't operate the crimper without it, they can be harmful. Crimped wristbands should be secure but comfortable: the aim is for them to not constrict bloodflow but to also not fall off peoples wrists. Some people may ask that their wristband is not crimped on: you should default to crimping, but use common sense. People who don't wish the wristband to be crimped should provide an explanation that you believe.

E.g. visibly burnt out components. Does anything smell broken? (This is actually quite a good method of detecting electrical damage). Based upon the above information, develop a list of parts that is likely to be damaged/broken. This list may include more parts that originally reported. If possible, request that the team/volunteer performs some quick tests of other parts of the kit to assess their functionality. E.g. try plugging the webcam into a PC and see if it works.

E.g. visibly burnt out components. Does anything smell broken? (This is actually quite a good method of detecting electrical damage). Based upon the above information, develop a list of parts that is likely to be damaged/broken. This list may include more parts that originally reported. If possible, request that the team/volunteer performs some quick tests of other parts of the kit to assess their functionality. E.g. try plugging the webcam into a PC and see if it works. Send a request to the Kit Logistics Coordinator to dispatch the necessary replacement parts. Inform the team/volunteer that replacement parts on in transit. Instruct the team/volunteer to place all broken parts (those that are being replaced) into a cardboard box, seal it, and mark it with the following: 'Suspected broken kit. Hand to reception at competition. See issue #NNN' where NNN is the number of the issue being used to track this claim. Note, the Kit Support Coordinator is not responsible for changing anything in the Inventory - the Kit Logistics Coordinator will handle it as appropriate.","title":"Assessing claims of broken kit"},{"location":"kit/hardware/","text":"Hardware Production Documentation \u00b6 This is the Hardware Production Coordinator's documentation.

See SR2017 Kit Collation Plan for a detailed plan. Process \u00b6 Each kit must go through the following process. Once the CHECKIN task has been performed for a given kit the remaining tasks can be run in parallel - especially the testing of different parts. The sequence of tasks is the same for all parts, however the specific requirements vary depending upon the part. CHECKIN - Unpack each kit and scan its contents into a single location in the Inventory. Any kit expected back from teams but not found is marked as missing. VISUAL - Visually inspect each part for damage. CLEAN - Clean each part. TEST - Test each part, where possible. CHECKOUT - Pack parts of the same type into boxes and update the Inventory. CHASEUP - [after event] Chase up missing parts. Throughout the process the state of each part is tracked through two fields: functional_condition (currently condition for backwards compatibility) and physical_condition . The functional_condition field has a value of either unknown , broken or working and is set based upon the outcome of the testing procedure carried out in the TEST task. The physical_condition field has one of the same three values that the functional_condition field can have, but it is set based upon a visual inspection of the part during the VISUAL task. We will only ship parts that have both a functional_condition and physical_condition of working . After the Kit Collation Event any parts with either a functional_condition or physical_condition of broken will be assessed to see whether they can be repaired or need to be replaced. CHECKIN \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner Duration: 1 person day Remove each part from the kit box and move it into a checked-in directory in the Inventory. There is no need to worry about keeping track of which team the part came from, as this information can be retrieved from the Inventory at a later date if required. Mark each part as having functional_condition: unknown and physical_condition: unknown . If the Inventory shows any parts remaining in the kit box after all of the parts have been physically removed move them into a missing directory. VISUAL \u00b6 Tools: Laptop, barcode/QR scanner, label printer Duration: 2 person days Inspect parts for visible physical damage - mild cosmetic damage is not a concern. Also apply a new asset sticker if the current one is damaged or illegible. See the following table for example of visible physical damage for each part. Note that a case is considered to be damaged if a panel is cracked entirely in half (or close to it) or if a piece has broken off such that the board can be touched.

There is roughly a month between the two events to allow for repairs to be made and replacement parts purchased. At the end of Kit Packing the kits are loaded onto a pallet and shipped to our post handling provider. The kits will later be forwarded to the various Kickstart locations once the number of teams at each location has been confirmed. Process \u00b6 Before kits can be packed, there is some preparation work that must be done. Each of these tasks can be performed in parallel. WIRE - The wire must be cut to length. CAMCON - The camcon connectors must be counted out and bagged. LAYOUT - Boxes of each type of part must be laid out around the room. Once the preparation tasks have been completed the packing can commence. The process is strictly sequential for each kit, but multiple kits may be flowing through the process simultaneously. FILL - Fill a kit box with the parts. SCAN - Scan and move all of the tracked parts into the box in the Inventory. CHECK - Perform a check of the box contents and check off everything on a check list. JIFFY - Pack the box contents into Jiffy bags. PACK - Pack the Jiffy bags and remaining parts into the box with scrunched up paper. PALLET - Once all kits have been packed they can be loaded onto a pallet. WIRE \u00b6 Each kit contains 3 lengths of thick (1mm\u00b2) wire and 4 lengths of thin (0.5mm\u00b2) wire. Since the wire is purchased on 100m reels it needs to be cut to length and folded/knotted ready for packing. The wire needs to be cut into the following: 1.8m lengths of 1mm\u00b2 wire (red, black and blue) 3m lengths of 0.5mm\u00b2 wire (red, black, blue and yellow) After being cut the wires should be folded and knotted. A demonstration on how to do this will be given at the event. CAMCON \u00b6 Each kit contains various 'Camcon' pluggable terminal block connectors. These must be counted/weighed out and bagged up. Fill resealable plastic bags with the following: 10x 7.5mm camcons 7x 5mm camcons 1x 3.81mm camcon LAYOUT \u00b6 To help with the filling of kits, boxes of each constituent part should be placed around the room such that one can easily walk around filling a kit box without missing a part. All parts should be laid out, including the wire and camcons, in 'part stations'. See the canonical kit list for reference. Each part station must have a sign by it indicating the quantity to be packed. See the kit list for these quantities. Some parts are designated for development use only and should not be shipped to teams. Since the parts processed at the Kit Collation Event are a mix of development and non-development the development ones need to be filtered out from the part stations. The following types of part have some designated for development and they must be removed before commencing the FILL task: Power Board: Development have red PCBs Servo Board: Development have red PCBs Motor Board: Development have red PCBs USB Hub: Development have a sticker on them stating so FILL \u00b6 Once all preparation steps have been completed the kit boxes can be filled with parts. Take an empty Really Useful Box and traverse the room, placing parts in the box as you go. Each station will have a sign indicating the quantity to be placed in the box. SCAN \u00b6 Once a box has been filled with all kit parts the parts that are tracked in the Inventory must be scanned to check that they are marked as working (both functionally and physically) and are not development parts. If all of the parts are valid then they should all be moved into the Really Useful Box in the Inventory. Once all of the tracked parts have been moved, the box should be physically marked to indicate it has completed the SCAN task (stick a piece of coloured tape on it). CHECK \u00b6 After the tracked parts have been moved in the Inventory the box contents should be verified and checked off on a check list . Ideally this task would be performed by a different person to the one who filled it and the one who moved it in the Inventory - to reduce the likelihood of systematic errors. Once the check list is complete it must be left in the box. JIFFY \u00b6 A checked kit (one that has a completed check list in it) is ready to have its parts safely wrapped for transport. This is done by putting the vulnerable parts of the kit into Jiffy bags. There are two sizes of Jiffy bags: small brown ones and large white ones. Place the following parts into the specified bags and do NOT seal them. Place the filled bags back into the box. Small brown: 2x motor boards, 1x ruggeduino Small brown: 1x power board, 1x servo board, 2x WiFi dongles, 1x USB stick Small brown: 2x USB hubs, 1x Odroid Large white: 1x tablet Large white: 1x battery charger Large white: 1x battery charger PSU, 1x webcam, 1x tablet charger PACK \u00b6 To prevent the Jiffy bags and remaining parts from moving around too much in transit the empty space needs to be filled. This is done by tearing off a few metres of brown paper from a roll and scrunching it up. Some scrunched paper should be placed at the bottom of the box. The parts should be placed on top of this and finally a layer of scrunched paper should be placed on the top. The lid should be secured with two cable ties through the lids/handles in diagonally opposite corners. PALLET \u00b6 The final task, once all kits have been packed, is to load them onto a wooden pallet. The pallet will then be shipped to our post handling provider, who will forward them onto Kickstart venues at our instruction. A standard pallet is 1.2x1.0m and the load can generally be up to 2m high (what is known as a 'full' pallet). The kit boxes should be stacked on the pallet in layers of 6 (2x3). They are 0.2m high so 54 kits results in a load height of 1.8m. When all of the kits have been stacked they must be strapped to the pallet using polypropylene strapping and finally the whole assembly wrapped in stretch wrap.","title":"Kit Packing"},{"location":"kit/hardware/kit-packing/#kit-packing","text":"The purpose Kit Packing is to take the tested parts from the Kit Collation Event and pack them into kits ready for use by teams.

CHECKIN \u00b6 All parts, excluding RUBs, are to be scanned into the kit-collation-venue/checked-in directory in the Inventory. Once all non-RUB parts have been moved each RUB should be checked to ensure it is empty and then moved into the kit-collation-venue/checked-in directory too. Any parts shown to be in the RUBs in the inventory should be moved into the kit-collation-venue/missing directory. lipo-bag-overlander-22x30 parts should be checked to ensure that they're empty.

Ideally the condition flag would be renamed to functional_condition , but this breaks the tooling so we'll leave it for now.

This is generally referred to as asset tracking. To allow SR to operate it is important that the location and state of all of its assets are known at all times. This chapter documents the high-level organisation aspects around SR asset tracking. It is not intended as a comprehensive user manual for the Inventory system, but rather how SR uses the system to track its assets. See the page on logistics-software for details of the inventory's datastore and tooling required to use it. The Inventory \u00b6 To record all of the necessary information regarding SR assets, all 1 assets are tracked in the Inventory. Unfortunately, due to historical use of the term, SR uses the term Inventory to refer to its asset tracking system. Normally inventory refers to a record of things that an organisation sells whereas assets are things that an organisation owns and uses to operate; tracked in its asset tracking system. It is not a big problem, but it is an unusual quirk to be aware of. Each asset, for example an individual webcam, has a corresponding record in the Inventory. Within this record various properties of the asset are held such that it is possible to unambiguously identify the matching asset from its Inventory record and conversely, identify the matching Inventory record from the asset. There is a one-to-one mapping of assets to Inventory records. Each type of asset is identified by its name ; for example a Logitech C270 webcam has the name webcam-logitech-c270 . All assets of the same type have the same name. When creating assets that do not have an existing name in the Inventory, care must be taken to ensure that the new name given to the asset is suitably descriptive. This ensures that it does not clash with future assets that are similar, but not the same; for example an asset with the name usb-charger is not descriptive enough, but usb-charger-a-500ma is. The Inventory primarily records the location of each asset, its value, its physical and functional condition, its asset code and a history of any changes made to any of these properties. Secondary to these properties, certain assets have extra information recorded such as MAC address (for assets that have an Ethernet or Bluetooth PHY), serial number and modification flags. To provide the one-to-one mapping between assets and their Inventory records, each asset/record pair have an asset code , which uniquely identifies them. An important part of maintaining this one-to-one mapping is ensuring that the asset code is suitably marked onto the asset such that it can be read in the future. Only property of SR is tracked in the Inventory; meaning that property of third parties must not be tracked in the Inventory. Asset Lifecycle \u00b6 For each asset that SR owns there is a reasonably well defined sequence of stages that it flows through during its lifetime. This flow is shown in the diagram below. graph LR create(Creation) commission(Commission) use(Use) test(Test) repair(Repair) modify(Modify) decommission(Decommission) disposal(Disposal) create-->commission commission-->use use-->modify use-->test use-->decommission modify-->test test-->repair test-->use test-->decommission repair-->test decommission-->disposal Creation \u00b6 When an asset is purchased or manufactured, a record must be entered into the Inventory. At this point a new asset code is automatically generated. The asset code must be marked onto the asset 2 . The asset code can be marked in the following ways: Printed paper label with QR code and text Dymo label with code128 barcode and text Handwritten with permanent marker UHF RFID tag 3 Programmed onto the asset (e.g. such that it is possible to read over USB) More than one of the above techniques can be used to provide redundancy. The ideal marking solution is both human and machine readable and should be durable. These criteria should be considered when deciding how to mark a particular asset. Programming the asset code onto the asset, where possible, provides a very high level of durability as there is no label or pen that can be damaged; However one has to physically plug a cable in to read the code. QR codes and barcodes have the advantage that physical contact with the asset is not required, but they do require the asset to be visible. UHF RFID tags provide the added benefit of allowing the asset code to be read even when they are not visible; for instance when it is in a box. Commission \u00b6 Some assets will require commissioning after they have been added to the Inventory. This can be best explained with an example: When a newly manufactured motor board is added to the Inventory it is yet to be programmed or fully tested (although it may have had some basic end-of-line testing performed upon it). Once it has been added to the Inventory, in the Creation stage, it is ready to be programmed and tested before being used. This initial programming and testing of the motor board is part of its commissioning process. Not all assets will require commissioning. Generally these are things such as USB hubs, where it is assumed that the manufacturer has suitably tested their product and there is no further programming required. Once an asset has been commissioned, its physical and functional condition must be updated appropriately in its record. In the case of assets that do not require any special commissioning procedure to be carried out, it should be assumed that they are both physically and functionally working and their records updated as such. Use \u00b6 Once an asset has been commissioned, or has been tested and shown to be working, it is ready to be used for its intended purpose. For the majority of assets this means that it will become part of a kit and ultimately be used by a team. During the use stage of an assets lifetime the majority of the updates to its record in the Inventory will be to keep track of its physical location; for example with a particular team. Occasionally there may also be other updates to its record required, such as adding a note to its description. Test \u00b6 The Inventory should, as far as is possible, represent the current state of all assets. However as time passes, the recorded physical and functional condition of a given asset will diverge from reality. To help rectify this, assets are regularly tested. For most assets this occurs once each year at the Kit Collation Event , run by the Hardware Production Coordinator . Assets that have been repaired or modified must also undergo testing. As in the commission stage, an asset's physical and functional condition must be updated appropriately in its record once it has been tested. If the asset is in full working order it is ready for use. If the asset is broken then it may be possible to repair it. In some situations it is either not cost effective or not possible to repair an asset. When this occurs, the asset is no longer useful to SR and will be decommissioned and disposed of. Repair \u00b6 If an asset is found to be broken, it may be possible to repair it. An example of this is a motor board that has a cracked case. It is trivial to replace the broken parts of the case and therefore allow the motor board to once again be used (after being retested). Modify \u00b6 Throughout the lifetime of an asset it may be necessary to perform modifications to it. This may be to add extra functionality, improve reliability or to fix a known problem. For most assets the opportunity to perform these modifications is at the Kit Collation Event, run by the Hardware Production Coordinator. If modifications are required they will perform them as necessary. When modifications are made to an asset it is important to track the changes in its Inventory record. These generally take the form of modification flags that indicate if a particular asset has been modified. If a modification across all assets of a given type is planed, for example soldering on an extra component to all motor boards, then all motor board Inventory records should be updated to indicate that none of them have received the modification. Once each asset is modified, its Inventory record must be updated appropriately. Decommission \u00b6 If an asset is broken and unrepairable or if an asset is simply no longer required then it must be decommissioned and then disposed of. The Kit Logistics Coordinator must only decommission and dispose of an asset when explicitly instructed to do so by the person responsible for the asset. TODO: Define who is responsible for each type of asset It must first be determined if the asset is to be sold/given away or if it is to be thrown away, as this affects the decommissioning process. Some assets will have specific decommissioning requirements, however in all cases there are common steps that must be taken. For assets that are to be sold or given to a third party all SR logos and 'property of' messages must be removed/obliterated. This ensures that future owners and users of the assets do not mistakenly think that it is property of SR and that SR itself does not mistakenly think that it is property belonging to SR. Once an asset has been fully decommissioned its Inventory record must be updated with a modification flag that indicates that it has been decommissioned. Disposal \u00b6 Once an asset has been decommissioned, it must be either sold/given away or thrown away, depending upon what was previously agreed when starting the decommissioning process. If an asset is to be sold the Kit Logistics Coordinator will work with the person previously responsible for that asset to determine the best way to sell the asset. If the estimated value of the asset at the time of selling is above \u00a350 then the trustees are to be be consulted. If an asset is to be thrown away the Kit Logistics Coordinator will work with the person previous responsible for that asset to determine if there are any special requirements regarding its disposal; for example WEEE regulations for electronics. Also if the value of the asset, as shown in its Inventory record, is above \u00a350 then the trustees are to be consulted. Once an asset has been disposed of, either via selling/giving away or by throwing away, its Inventory record must be removed from the Inventory. Only records that have a decommissioned modification flag should be removed from the Inventory. This is not strictly true as certain low-value assets are not tracked. A general rule-of-thumb is that anything under \u00a35 is not tracked. \u21a9 There was historically a concept of 'deferred labelling', where a record was added to the Inventory and the asset labelled at a later time. This approach is no longer used as it can result in assets going unlabelled. \u21a9 Currently in the planning stage. \u21a9","title":"Asset Tracking"},{"location":"kit/logistics/asset-tracking/#asset-tracking","text":"One of the responsibilities of the Kit Logistics Coordinator is to maintain a record of the location and state of all SRs assets.

No one else is expected to follow these procedures, they are for internal documentation only. Shipping kits to Kickstarts \u00b6 To provide sufficient time for problems/delays, kits should be shipped to Kickstart locations no later than 1 week before Kickstart. Shipping the kits many weeks in advance may not be possible due to limited storage requirements at some Kickstart locations. First ensure that the Kickstart Event Coordinator is aware of the paperwork requirements (handout forms and disclaimers). Request the following information from the Kickstart Event Coordinator: Name of Local Kickstart Event Coordinator Email address of Local Kickstart Event Coordinator Number of teams attending Name of person able to receive the kit (if not the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator) Email address of person able to receive the kit (if not the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator) Phone number of person able to receive the kit Address to ship the kit to For each Kickstart: Ensure that the Local Kickstart Event Coordinator, or the person that they are delegating kit management to, has received the necessary training (to be defined). Identify the kits to be shipped in the Inventory and move them into an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-oxford-ks ). Instruct UK Postbox to forward the correct items to the recipient. Once UK Postbox have forwarded on the kits, email the LKEC and the recipient (if not the LKEC) with the tracking number/link and a list of kit asset numbers shipped to them. Ask them to report back when they have received the shipment and doubled checked that they have the expected kits. Once the kits have been delivered, move them in the Inventory to an appropriate sub directory (e.g. kickstart-venues/oxford ). Email details of what kits are where to the Kickstart Event Coordinator so that they can prepare handout forms for each of the Local Kickstart Event Coordinators. After Kickstart, request scanned copies of the handout form and disclaimers from all of the Kickstarts from the Kickstart Event Coordinator (who will then request them from the Local Kickstart Coordinators). Move each kit into an appropriate sub directory in the Inventory based upon which team it was given to (e.g. move a kit to teams/2017/srz ). Shipping kits to teams that didn't attend a Kickstart \u00b6 The operations manual currently requires that the Kit Logistics Coordinator ensures that kits are available to be collected by a courier no later than 2 week after Kickstart. Begin by requesting the following information from the Team Coordinator for the teams that didn't attend a Kickstart and ask them to confirm that the details are correct via the appropriate local teams coordinator: Name of local teams coordinator Email of local teams coordinator (so that any further queries and an email containing a tracking link doesn't have to go via the Team Coordinator) Name of recipient Email of recipient Phone number of recipient (ideally a mobile number as that's what couriers prefer) Address including: School name Number (if applicable) Street Town/City County Postcode For each team that needs a kit: Identify the kit to be shipped in the Inventory and move it to an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-srz ). Once the details have been confirmed, instruct UK Postbox to forward the correct item to the team. Once UK Postbox have forwarded on the kit, email the local teams coordinator with the tracking number/link so that they can pass it onto the team. Get them to ask the team to inform them when the kit has been delivered. Once the kit has been delivered, move the kit in the Inventory to the appropriate team sub directory (e.g. teams/2017/srz ). Managing kits not collected at Kickstart \u00b6 Some teams may not turn up at Kickstart, therefore leaving their kit uncollected. This kit needs to either be stored safely by someone nearby or returned to UK Postbox. The kit will most likely make its way to a team (either the originally intended recipient or otherwise) in the week or two after Kickstart. If a responsible person in attendance at the Kickstart event (for example the Local Kickstart Coordinator) is willing to store the kit for a week or two, and is able to make it available for courier collection, then this is preferable. If it is not possible to store the kit locally, it must be returned to UK Postbox ASAP. A Return Shipping Pack must be used to package the kit for return. Someone (possibly the venue) will need to make the kit available for courier collection in the day or two following Kickstart. Reallocating kits from drop-outs \u00b6 We need to ship kits from one team to another when a team drops out. TBD. Shipping spares/replacements \u00b6 When parts of the kit break teams need replacements. The Kit Logistics Coordinator needs to ship these spares/replacements to teams when instructed to do so by the Kit Support Coordinator. Begin by requesting the following information from the Team Coordinator for the team that needs replacement parts shipping to them and ask them to confirm that the details are correct via the appropriate local teams coordinator: Name of local teams coordinator Email of local teams coordinator (so that any further queries and an email containing a tracking link doesn't have to go via the Team Coordinator) Name of recipient Email of recipient Phone number of recipient (ideally a mobile number as that's what couriers prefer) Address including: School name Number (if applicable) Street Town/City County Postcode Identify the replacement parts to be shipped in the Inventory (as defined by the Kit Support Coordinator) and move them to an appropriate in-transit sub directory (e.g. in-transit/to-srz ). Package the parts into a cardboard box, using Jiffy bags, bubblewrap or similar to protect the parts. Once the details have been confirmed, arrange for the package to be collected from yourself and delivered to the team. Once you have the tracking number from the courier, email the local teams coordinator with the tracking number/link so that they can pass it onto the team. Get them to ask the team to inform them when the kit has been delivered. Once the kit has been delivered, move the kit in the Inventory to the appropriate team sub directory (e.g. teams/2017/srz ). Shipping kits to storage at the end of the competition \u00b6 At the end of the competition we have the majority of the kits returned to us. The Competition Team Coordinator is responsible for managing the return process. The Kit Logistics Coordinator can aid in this process and is responsible for shipping the kits to storage after they have been returned. TBD. Ensuring the timely return of kits not returned at the competition \u00b6 Some teams will have been given permission to retain their kit for a while after the competition. The teams are responsible for arranging and paying for a courier to return the kit to us. The Kit Logistics Coordinator is responsible for assisting teams in this process and ensuring that all kits are returned by the 1 st June of the same year that the competition was held in. TBD. Shipping of non-team kits and development tools to volunteers \u00b6 Non-team kits (those that are classed as development, support, PR or local) and development tools need to be shipped around as deemed appropriate by the person responsible for their allocation. That being the Kit Coordinator for development kits and tools, the Kit Support Coordinator for support kits, the PR coordinator for PR kits and the Team Coordinator for local kits. TBD. Shipping of non-kit assets \u00b6 Most assets are kit related. However, a few assets are not kits or parts thereof. This is mostly competition hardware such as arena walls. The Kit Logistics Coordinator is also responsible for shipping these non-kit assets when required.

Purpose \u00b6 The role of the LSM is to maintain the operation of the legacy server inherited by Student Robotics prior to the formation of the CIO. The legacy server is defined as the Linode server known as 'saffron'. This machine currently hosts a selection of services, the management of which fall under multiple roles in the CIO organisational structure. Due to the multiplicity of the legacy server, it is desired for it to be retired and replaced with a system that allows for running of services managed by separate roles to be fully independent of one another. Since there is the intention to ultimately retire the legacy server, this role has an inherently finite lifetime. Once the server has been retired this role will cease to exist.

Low barrier to entry \u00b6 The kit that we distribute is a lever with which we lower the barrier. 2. Target shape of performance versus payoff function \u00b6 We can create three loose categories of robots: Poor: We want these to still be able to score a few points, but not really achieve much beyond that. Good: The game should aim to spread these robots out in points-space as much as possible. Excellent: Matches between the awesome robots should be as close as possible. This makes the competition exciting, as it should lead to a close final. 3. Axes of exploration \u00b6 There are three general engineering disciplines we want to provide as axes of exploration: Software Mechanics Electronics The scope for development within these axes should be well-balanced. A team should not have to extensively explore all of these axes to compete. 4. Engineering goals should be encouraged \u00b6 Robot 'intelligence' and strategy. State. Robots that are more than just reflexive are more interesting. Reliability. Robots should not fall apart, software should not fall apart. Technical 'insanity'. Things that are technically advanced are awesome. 5. Games should be a spectacle \u00b6 Fun to watch. Fun to play. No conclusion: must be very unlikely to end before time is up, or result in stalemates. Continuous action: camping/sitting must not be encouraged. 6. Game must be a non-contact sport \u00b6 Pushing, breaking, beating, etc. of other robots must not be encouraged. 7.

Overview of Role \u00b6 As game design coordinator, it is your responsibility to ensure that we end up with a suitable game design for the Student Robotics Competition Programme. As you will find in the ops manual, your responsibilities are: Designing the game. Producing publishable rules for the game well in advance of Kickstart. Ensuring that the details of the game are not publicly available until Kickstart. Updating the published rules throughout the year in response to rule clarification requests. Game Selection Process \u00b6 This game selection process is currently in draft-form within the ops manual. Please do ask for a copy of this draft version, as it provides a good overview of the intended process. In short, the new process is intended to allow volunteers to submit game ideas, whilst ensuring that it is an enjoyable process for all involved. It consists of the following stages: \"Informal discussions\". \"Proposals\", in which people may submit descriptions of their game ideas to you. \"Feedback\", in which volunteers have the opportunity to read proposals, and comment once on their strengths and weaknesses. \"Selection\", in which you gather responses to criticisms from game proposal authors (after appropriately filtering and collating them), and then select a game based upon the proposals, feedback and responses. You should also consult the Kit Coordinator regarding the technical appropriateness of each proposal. \"Revision\", in which you develop the final game rules, working together with the volunteer who submitted the game proposal (if they wish to participate!). Rules Structure \u00b6 In previous years, the rules have consisted of several sections. We are considering breaking these apart into separate documents (or web pages), to reduce the potentially overwhelming nature of the rulebook. The resulting documents would be: Game rules, describing what the game itself is, how scoring works, as well as how each match runs. Regulations, detailing all technical requirements that robots must adhere to in order to compete. Specifications that describe the layout of the arena, and props within it. Awards. Kit return (Which parts of the kit will be returned). Not all of the above should be your responsibility as the game design coordinator -- you are only responsible for the game rules and specifications of the props within the arena. The other parts will be dealt with by the Kit Coordinator, Kit Support Coordiantor and Competition Programme Coordinator.

Dear Team Leaders, Thank you all so much for being part of SR2017 \u2013 this year\u2019s competition was brilliant fun and an excellent showcase for all your hard work over the year. We would, of course, appreciate your feedback on your experience of the competition as we are always striving to make Student Robotics as good as it possibly can be. Write to the organisation associated with teams who dropped out without notifying SR in advance. \u00b6 Example of email sent to non-informed dropout teams in 2017: Dear Head Teacher, I am sorry to have to bring this to your attention but we felt it was important to inform you that a member of your staff entered a team in this year\u2019s Student Robotics programme and was duly assigned a place and provided with a kit and the associated support. However, they did not inform us that they were intending to drop out and not compete at this year\u2019s competition in April 2017. Moreover, despite numerous reminders and contact being attempted to ensure prompt return of their kit, they are still in possession of the SR kit nearly three months after the competition. We do appreciate that sometimes things do not go to plan and despite one\u2019s best efforts, it is not possible to progress with the Student Robotics programme, by either failing to get a team together or making progress with building the robot. In such situations, we do understand when teams inform us and explain their predicament and if we can, we suggest ways of working around the problems with more support or input. If a team is unable to continue and sadly needs to drop out, depending on the stage at which this occurs, we sometimes try to get the kit back from them so that we can pass it on to another team who will benefit from the kit and experience. If it\u2019s too late to do this then we will update our systems so that we are not expecting you on the day of the competition and make a note to contact you regarding kit return in due course. However, in your case, as your member of staff (the Team Leader) did not alert us to the fact their team were dropping out this meant that another team (and we had a waiting list of teams who were desperate to get their hands on a kit) were denied the chance to benefit from the various skills and experience that participating in Student Robotics provides and the opportunity to compete in this year\u2019s competition. Moreover, our volunteers have wasted their time by trying to contact and engage you when they could have spent time helping teams who were actually participating. As I mentioned before, the discourtesy continues by how our repeated contact to chase your member of staff to return the SR kit to us has been ignored. They are in receipt of a shipping pack with instructions of how to return the kit to us but we have still not received it, to date. I\u2019m sure that you would agree that this is not acceptable behaviour and does not set a good example to your students. We have made a note that your organisation\u2019s team dropped out without informing anyone and this will impact on any applications to enter Student Robotics in future years. As a charity which was set up to benefit as many young people as possible we just cannot afford the negative impacts of teams, such as yours, who do not value the opportunity given to them. Although we appreciate that there are many pressures on teachers, we have been saddened by the lack of courtesy extended to us throughout this process. Please ensure that the SR kit is returned to us urgently. Feedback \u00b6 The Team Coordinator should seek feedback from the Team Leaders, LTCs and Mentors on their experiences and consider updating and refining processes. In addition, the Team Coordinator should also reflect on own processes and update and refine as appropriate. The Team Coordinator should liaise with relevant members of the SR team to improve processes. Update Team Archive \u00b6 Update Team Archive document with outcome of teams from this year's competition, i.e. whether dropped out (and when) or competed.

We have a variety of skills and backgrounds, but share a passion for encouraging the teams through the medium of robotics. There are a lots of different ways you can get involved. Whether it's mentoring a team through the competition year, helping run one of our events or developing our hardware or software, this runbook is the place to look for guidance on how we do things. What to expect \u00b6 When you first start helping out, you'll have a chat with a volunteer co-ordinator who will be able to tell you a bit more about how we're organised and work with you to find things you'd like to help with. They'll also ask you for contact details and for you to read the Code of Conduct . They'll also be able to answer any questions you have about the organisation and get you set up with accounts on our collaboration platforms (we primarily use Slack and GitHub ). Responsibilities \u00b6 Everyone will contribute in different ways and has a range of different experiences. It's up to each of us to create the community we want to be a part of. Reliability, communication and taking ownership \u00b6 Our time as volunteers is precious, so its important that we spend it on making things happen or enabling those who are doing that. Please be clear with about what you're working on and how it's going. This helps others know where they can help and creates a reference for the future. It's completely fine to say no to things or to explicitly drop them if you don't have the capacity. We trust you to balance your contributions to SR with the rest of your life. It's better to say no to something than say yes and not do it. Being empathetic and creating a safe environment \u00b6 We should be thinking about others whenever we do something, acknowledging the effort they may have put in before criticising. For example: if you're reviewing something a colleague has been working hard on, and all you do is say \"Approved, but needs a couple of changes\" then you haven't thought about the effect that has on the person, nor have you considered the power of saying something more congratulatory and celebratory. We aim to be compassionate and care about other volunteers. Everybody should want to create and enjoy a safe, fun place to contribute, where people can take risks without fear of ridicule or retribution, where all questions are answered in a friendly and empathetic manner, where people consider the position of others before responding, and where everybody's default position isn't to prove something about themselves, but to help their colleagues to grow and improve.

Finding a level \u00b6 It\u2019s important to pitch your support at the right level for the person you\u2019re helping, so that they\u2019re able to absorb what you\u2019re saying. One way to think about this is adding branches to a trunk of knowledge; if the trunk is a sapling then adding a large bough with many branches will crush the sapling. Conversely, presenting a bud of information can be frustrating for both parties if the person you\u2019re helping is more experienced. For complete novices, or when very first introducing a new topic (even to an experienced audience), this means that you should try to present an idea in its very simplest form. Try to think about the essence of what makes the idea important, rather than the details of how it works. A good example of this is the idea of \u201c lies to children \u201d. As a concrete example, let\u2019s consider the case of explaining variable assignment in Python: foo = 42 A simple explanation here might be that we are \u201ctelling the computer to remember that \u2018foo\u2019 means \u201842\u2019\u201d. Note that there\u2019s no mention here of \u201cvariable\u201d, \u201cidentifier\u201d, \u201cassignment\u201d, \u201cinteger\u201d or even \u201cnumber\u201d. Depending on your audience, this might be a useful description. For an audience which has some programming experience, though perhaps not in Python, you might instead describe this as \u201cassigning 42 to the variable \u2018foo\u2019\u201d. Note that while there are some technical terms here, there\u2019s still no mention of what identifiers are or what their naming rules are. It\u2019s fine to leave explaining those until they become important. A superb example of this in action is this video explaining quantum computing at five levels of depth . Explaining the \u201chow\u201d \u00b6 Of course after a while many students will want to understand the \u201chow\u201d of something as well as the \u201cwhat\u201d. The point where they start wanting to know this varies from person to person as does the impact it has on their learning. As a result, while a hand-waved explanation (ignoring the man behind the curtain) will suffice when initially explaining a topic, you should be willing to explain in more detail if the student asks. Bear in mind that you still need to find the right level on this axis too -- if you switch to a very detailed explanation then it can still bewilder the learner. For example, in the case of our variable assignment, you might be asked how the computer understands the idea of 42, or how it\u2019s stored. A first response might be to talk about the differences between numbers (used for addition, etc.) and strings (used for text). Even if you do end up talking about the different in-memory representations (perhaps the learner has already heard about ASCII), you\u2019d almost certainly want to avoid talking about the internals of CPython objects. This line of questioning is sometimes related to the student trying to attach or relate the new topic so something they already know, but not being sure what the connections are. It\u2019s reasonable to ask the student if this is the case, either by asking why they\u2019re asking for more details (\u201cwhat makes you ask that?\u201d) or if they\u2019ve seen something similar before. Learn by doing \u00b6 As much as possible, encourage the learner to experiment with what they\u2019ve just learned. Learning is reinforced by putting it into practise and is often most enjoyable when discovering new things out for yourself. For our learning Python example, this means getting the learner into a Python shell or similar environment where they can easily try new things. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re not writing a full program yet, the feedback loop from trying things and experiencing that there\u2019s no downside to things not working as hoped is what you\u2019re after. Keep it interactive \u00b6 Initially when explaining something you\u2019ll need to mostly be telling the learner what things are and what they do. At this stage, it\u2019s important to gauge their reaction to ensure you\u2019re going at a pace that works for them. If there\u2019s something you\u2019re not sure that they\u2019re understanding, do ask them! Once the learner has formed enough of a basis of understanding of a topic you can start asking them to explain how they think things might work if there were slight variations. In our Python example, you might show a conditional block: foo = 42 if foo > 25: print('greater') print('nope') And then ask the learner either what they think might happen if you changed the > to a < or to change the code to detect a different range of numbers. In either case you don\u2019t need to tell them whether they\u2019re right or not, but instead encourage them to try it themselves so that they can learn by doing. For more advanced learners (much closer to your own level of understanding), then pair programming techniques can start to be used. You may have noticed that what\u2019s described here is similar to the approach of having a driver who operates the machinery (changing the code) and a navigator who guides the overall direction (towards deeper understanding), albeit far less rigorous. Let them do the thinking (provide options not answers) \u00b6 It\u2019s very tempting and very easy to just give a learner the answer to their question. While that can be suitable (for example if they\u2019re clearly completely stuck), it doesn\u2019t necessarily help them understand a topic. If you can break down the thing they\u2019re trying to learn into small chunks and then ask them how they think they\u2019d achieve each of the pieces, then this can both help them understand that topic better as well as how to apply the knowledge they already have. While you need to be careful that it doesn\u2019t turn a learning session into a never-ending series of brain teasers (which can be tiresome), this can be a useful approach. It\u2019s reasonable to explain to the learner that the approach of breaking down a puzzle is a useful one and that that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to approach it. Using our Python example again, you might start with a task of \u201cprint odd numbers up to 20\u201d. It can seem that there\u2019s not much to this, however there are a number of aspects which a novice might not know about -- at least: loops, mathematical operations, conditional blocks and printing variables. For each of these you can spend a little bit of time just explaining the basic concept and letting them explore how it works before getting them to bring the pieces together. If you had lots of time, that might look something like this: Explain print(\"some text\") Ask them to make it print \u201csome other text\u201d Explain foo = 42; print(foo) Ask them to make it print a different number Explain for foo in range(5): print(foo) note: I probably wouldn\u2019t at this point explain the interaction between in and range being a generator; I\u2019d probably just think about this like a loop over numbers Ask them to make it print up to a higher limit Explain foo = 42 % 3; print(foo) Ask them to make it detect numbers divisible by something else Explain foo = 42; if foo == 42: print(\"yes\") Ask them to make it print if the number is divisible by three Ask them if they now think they could solve the original task, and what that might look like Helping when they\u2019re \u201cstuck\u201d \u00b6 When a learner complains that they\u2019re stuck it can be particularly tempting to give them the answer. However just as when giving a friend advice, it can be more useful to help them think through the problem themselves. Get them to explain the problem they\u2019re trying to solve and what they\u2019ve done so far to fix it. This will help you understand their perspective, which you can then use to guide them towards a solution. It can also act as a rubber-duck device allowing them to realise why something doesn\u2019t for themselves. Answering their questions \u00b6 Even the best teachers expect to be asked questions. You should ensure that you allow the learner opportunities to ask you questions and treat those questions with respect. It\u2019s important that they feel that they can ask for help and know that they\u2019ll be supported rather than scorned. There are two extremes here, both of which deserve consideration. Firstly, if they ask a question which seems obvious to you, you should bear in mind that (for technical topics) they likely have less experience than you and thus don\u2019t have the luxury of a more complete picture. It may help you to think about them as being one of the people who, at that moment, is lucky to be discovering something new and you as the person who gets to share the knowledge with them. (Some estimates suggest around 10,000 people find out about any given topic on a given day!) Secondly, it\u2019s possible that they may ask something which uncovers something that you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s completely fine (even encouraged) to admit that you don\u2019t know something. If the question is on topic, you could then work together to find out the answer. (This may even be something you thought you knew, but their question yields new insights). Example phrases \u00b6 Here are some sentence starters you might find useful: Have you considered ...

It\u2019s important that they feel that they can ask for help and know that they\u2019ll be supported rather than scorned. There are two extremes here, both of which deserve consideration. Firstly, if they ask a question which seems obvious to you, you should bear in mind that (for technical topics) they likely have less experience than you and thus don\u2019t have the luxury of a more complete picture. It may help you to think about them as being one of the people who, at that moment, is lucky to be discovering something new and you as the person who gets to share the knowledge with them. (Some estimates suggest around 10,000 people find out about any given topic on a given day!) Secondly, it\u2019s possible that they may ask something which uncovers something that you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s completely fine (even encouraged) to admit that you don\u2019t know something. If the question is on topic, you could then work together to find out the answer.
